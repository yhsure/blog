            Welcome weary traveler of the web, it looks like you've stumbled upon part of my web of thoughts and other things!
            Feel free to poke around but don't expect anything here to be remotely polished, accurate, or well-linked.
            This is mostly an internal thought dump that I've decided to publish in the hopes that something in here inspires someone or something.
