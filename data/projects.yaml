    Speech2Braille was created to help the over 360 million people in the 
    world who have debilitating hearing loss. This project entailed creating 
    an end-to-end speech recognition system using an Deep LSTM and a portable 
    device to display braille. The device is able to recognize audio and transcribe 
    it into Braille through the haptic feedback device via the neural network. The 
    feedback device is a self-made GPIO hat, consisting of 6 solenoids, and allows the Raspberry 
    Pi to control the 6 solenoids via the GPIO outputs. The neural network itself is 2 layered LSTM 
    network with 256 hidden cells in each layer. Won Silver and 10k in awards at the Canada Wide Science Fair.

    PacketBook is a financial accessibility chatbot, fully accessible through 
    the SMS (text messaging) protocol. Users are able to issue simple commands to 
    register, check their balance, deposit, withdraw, and send money. These commands 
    are secured with two-factor authentication through a Flask server on Heroku 
    with Twilio. The backend that handles transaction is written with Node and Express 
    and deployed on stdlib. PacketBook is unique in that it leverages the Stellar 
    blockchain and tokens (XLM) for its transactions which greatly reduces operating 
    overhead with its minimal transaction costs (around 1/100 of a cent per transaction).

    This project is an Envoy service mesh skeleton with External Authorization and Custom 
    Header Injection. This proof of concept shows that Envoy can be used in conjunction 
    with external auth (ext-authz) to manage routing, headers, and auth. As an added bonus, 
    Envoy allows easy built-in load balancing. Intended to be used as a skeleton project 
    to reduce boilerplate in future Go service mesh projects.
