    ctrl-v is a modern, open-source pastebin with LaTeX and Markdown rendering support. Any user can create a paste without an account, with the ability to protect it with a password and set an expiry date. Additionally, ctrl-v does code highlighting as well as LaTeX and Markdown rendering. Pastes are stored in a MongoDB Atlas instance. Backend is a containerized Go service deployed on Google Cloud Run. Frontend is a React app deployed via Firebase Hosting.

    reflect is a browser extension focused around asking users to reflect before visiting distracting sites, helping to
    reduce mindless scrolling while still being able to get work done. During closed-beta, we created a Go service that logged 
    user intents to a Cloud SQL database and did intent classification by serving a basic Flask API. We then trained an LSTM network 
    in Keras on the closed-beta data and augmented it using NLP data augmentation techniques, reaching ~86% classification accuracy.
    Finally, the model was ported to Tensorflow.js where it runs in-browser within the extension which is written in Typescript.

    The nwPlus livesite aims to be a central information hub for hackers which will contain important information about an ongoing hackathon. The core features of the site are that it has a calendar display, live announcements and notifcations, and embedded Twitch stream. Built from scratch in React, and reads information from a Firestore database.

    nanoDB arose out of many frustrations I've personally come across while prototyping, namely 1) difficulty of debugging data 2) faffing around with language specific drivers and 3) reference resolution. As a result, nanoDB stores everything on disk as a JSON document, has built-in reference resolution, and can be used fully through a REST API. Think of it like Redis but with MongoDB style documents â€” all of which is on-disk, human-readable, and through a REST API. The project is fully written in Go and is thoroughly unit-tested. It features a standalone server binary which creates a nanoDB server, as well as a shell which allows you to do some basic document inspection.

    readAR is a mobile AR app re-renders text to be more dyslexic-friendly, and 
    adds context-dependent word definitions and images. A custom BERT model was created and trained
    for word sense disambiguation (WSD), achieving a 76.6% F1% score on the test dataset which is only ~5% away from
    state-of-the-art. This model is served through Flask on an Oracle VM Instance. The API is also responsible for 
    our image processing pipeline, which is a conglomerate of different Azure APIs (OCR, Text Analytics, Bing Search).
    Built at TreeHacks 2020, winning the Microsoft Azure Champ Prize - Hack for Good.

    Speech2Braille was created to help the over 360 million people in the 
    world who have debilitating hearing loss. This project entailed creating 
    an end-to-end speech recognition system using an Deep LSTM and a portable 
    device to display braille. The device is able to recognize audio and transcribe 
    it into Braille through the haptic feedback device via a novel neural network architecture. The 
    feedback device is a self-made GPIO hat, consisting of 6 solenoids. The neural network itself is 2 layered LSTM-CTC 
    network with 256 hidden cells in each layer, achieving 92% state-of-the-art word error rate on the TIMIT dataset. 
    Won Silver and 10k in awards at the Canada Wide Science Fair.

    PacketBook is a financial accessibility chatbot, fully accessible through 
    the SMS (text messaging) protocol. Users are able to issue simple commands to 
    register, check their balance, deposit, withdraw, and send money. These commands 
    are secured with two-factor authentication through a Flask server on Heroku 
    with Twilio. The backend that handles transaction is written with Node and Express 
    and deployed on stdlib. PacketBook is unique in that it leverages the Stellar 
    blockchain and tokens (XLM) for its transactions which greatly reduces operating 
    overhead with its minimal transaction costs (around 1/100 of a cent per transaction).

    I got tired of adding divs and text manually everytime I wanted to update a project/add new stuff, so I decided to something more powerful that supports templating to do it for me automatically. It takes advantage of Go templates in order to generate the site from just a few config files! Now, updating the site is as simple as editing a YAML file. Continous integration and deployment done through Github Actions.
