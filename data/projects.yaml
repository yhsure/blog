    reflect is a browser extension focused around asking users to reflect before visiting distracting sites, helping to
    reduce mindless scrolling while still being able to get work done. A basic LSTM network was trained on survey data that
    we collected to do intent classification. An ingress proxy was also created to perform statistics aggregation and rate limiting. 
    Both were containerized and networked with Kubernetes. A CI/CD pipeline was created through CircleCI which deploys changes to Google Kubernetes
    Engine. The actual extension is a simple Chrome extension written in TypeScript that interfaces with our backend.

    readAR is a mobile AR app re-renders text to be more dyslexic-friendly, and 
    adds context-dependent word definitions and images. A custom BERT model was created and trained
    for word sense disambiguation (WSD), achieving a 76.6% F1% score on the test dataset which is only ~5% away from
    state-of-the-art. This model is served through Flask on an Oracle VM Instance. The API is also responsible for 
    our image processing pipeline, which is a conglomerate of different Azure APIs (OCR, Text Analytics, Bing Search).
    Built at TreeHacks 2020, winning the Microsoft Azure Champ Prize - Hack for Good.

    Speech2Braille was created to help the over 360 million people in the 
    world who have debilitating hearing loss. This project entailed creating 
    an end-to-end speech recognition system using an Deep LSTM and a portable 
    device to display braille. The device is able to recognize audio and transcribe 
    it into Braille through the haptic feedback device via a novel neural network architecture. The 
    feedback device is a self-made GPIO hat, consisting of 6 solenoids. The neural network itself is 2 layered LSTM-CTC 
    network with 256 hidden cells in each layer, achieving 92% state-of-the-art word error rate on the TIMIT dataset. 
    Won Silver and 10k in awards at the Canada Wide Science Fair.

    PacketBook is a financial accessibility chatbot, fully accessible through 
    the SMS (text messaging) protocol. Users are able to issue simple commands to 
    register, check their balance, deposit, withdraw, and send money. These commands 
    are secured with two-factor authentication through a Flask server on Heroku 
    with Twilio. The backend that handles transaction is written with Node and Express 
    and deployed on stdlib. PacketBook is unique in that it leverages the Stellar 
    blockchain and tokens (XLM) for its transactions which greatly reduces operating 
    overhead with its minimal transaction costs (around 1/100 of a cent per transaction).

    This project is an Envoy service mesh skeleton with External Authorization and Custom 
    Header Injection. This proof of concept shows that Envoy can be used in conjunction 
    with external auth (ext-authz) to manage routing, headers, and auth. As an added bonus, 
    Envoy allows easy built-in load balancing. Intended to be used as a skeleton project 
    to reduce boilerplate in future Go service mesh projects.
