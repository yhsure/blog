  things:
    Selected as one of 144 fellows to be part of the inaugural class of the MLH Fellowship program from a pool of 20,000 applicants. Worked on BentoML, an open-source framework for high-performance ML model serving. Reduced docker image size by 60% to enable lighter deployments by building Debian-slim based Docker images for model server. Created Helm chart allowing users to deploy the model storage component to a Kubernetes cluster with a single command rather than needing to follow an entire guide.
