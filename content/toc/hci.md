> Better HCI is better empathy

What even is HCI?
* The human-machine joint performance of tasks
* Human-computer or human-human communication mediated by computers

Many a clever invention has been termed ‘before its time’ because the inventor did not see how to build a transition from what was known and in use to what was new.

3 main goals of HCI
1. Designing
2. Implementing
3. Evaluating

As designers, we are **defining systems**, and implementing the structures that **create culture**. We have the responsibility to think about the world as a complicated, ethically fraught place

_Always ask:_ who are my users, and what are their needs?

## Terminology
Needs are problems that people have. Tasks are what they need to do.

### Design concept
-  High level, abstract, descriptive
-  How we talk about "properties" of an interface (e.g. "signifier", "visibility", or a relationship with a user in the case of "affordance")

### Design principle/heuristic/guideline
-  Help you implement the concept
-  Typically prescriptive althought they can conflict with each other

## Concepts

### Ethics Code
-   Participants
    -   must be **19 or over,** or **if UBC student, 17 or over**
    -   must be able to understand what they're consenting to
    -   not vulnerable relative to the student researchers
-   Risk
    -   no contentious questions or offensive materials
    -   no physical risks
    -   no personal data
    -   no personal imagery shown publicly
    -   all data kept in Canada

Consent will be obtained explicitly in one of the following ways:

2. through the participant signing a consent form (general consent), or
3. by replying affirmatively to an email that contains the consent form text (general consent).
