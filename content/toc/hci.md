> Better HCI is better empathy

What even is HCI?
* The human-machine joint performance of tasks
* Human-computer or human-human communicationmediated by computers

3 main goals of HCI
1. Designing
2. Implementing
3. Evaluating

As designers, we are **defining systems**, and implementing the structures that **create culture**. We have the responsibility to think about the world as a complicated, ethically fraught place

_Always ask:_ who are my users, and what are their needs?

## Terminology
Needs are problems that people have. Tasks are what they need to do.

### Design concept
-  High level, abstract, descriptive
-  How we talk about "properties" of an interface (e.g. "signifier", "visibility", or a relationship with a user in the case of "affordance")

### Design principle/heuristic/guideline
-  Help you implement the concept
-  Typically prescriptive althought they can conflict with each other

## Concepts
- [The Psychopathology of Everyday Things](thoughts/articles/the-psychopathology-of-everyday-things.md)
- [Human Centered Design (HCD)](thoughts/human-centered-design.md): contains design concepts
- [Double Diamond Model of Design](thoughts/double-diamond-design.md)
- [Design Process](thoughts/design-process.md)
- [Interaction Failures](thoughts/interaction-failures.md)
- [Design Goals](thoughts/design-goals.md)
- [User Involvement](thoughts/user-involvement.md)
- [Interviews and data recording](thoughts/interviews-and-data-recording.md)
