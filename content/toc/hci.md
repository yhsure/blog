> Better HCI is better empathy

What even is HCI?
* The human-machine joint performance of tasks
* Human-computer or human-human communicationmediated by computers

3 main goals of HCI
1. Designing
2. Implementing
3. Evaluating

As designers, we are **defining systems**, and implementing the structures that **create culture**. We have the responsibility to think about the world as a complicated, ethically fraught place

_Always ask:_ who are my users, and what are their needs?

## Terminology
### Design concept
-  High level, abstract, descriptive
-  How we talk about "properties" of an interface (e.g. "signifier", "visibility", or a relationship with a user in the case of "affordance")

### Design principle/heuristic/guideline
-  Help you implement the concept
-  Typically prescriptive althought they can conflict with each other

## Concepts
- [The Psychopathology of Everyday Things](thoughts/articles/the-psychopathology-of-everyday-things.md)
- [Human Centered Design (HCD)](thoughts/human-centered-design.md): contains design concepts
- [Double Diamond Model of Design](thoughts/double-diamond-design.md)
- [Design Process](thoughts/design-process.md)
- [Interaction Failures](thoughts/interaction-failures.md)
- [Design Goals](thoughts/design-goals.md)
- [User Involvement](thoughts/user-involvement.md)

## Data Recording
- What is data? Anything that is useful for understanding a particular design, user needs, and user behaviour.
- What does it mean to collect user data? What techniques can be used, and how useful and reliable is the data that is collected?

Five Key Issues
1. Settings Goals. Goals will influence the nature of data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and the analysis to be performed.
2. Identifying Participants. Those who fit the profile of types of people from whom data can be gathered are called the study population. Types of sampling are as follows:
  - Probability Sampling: simple random sampling or stratified sampling
  - Nonprobability Sampling: convenience sampling or volunteer panels
    - Convenience Sampling: sample includes those who were available rather than those specifically selected
3. Relationship with Participants: informed consent with a clear and professional relationship between participant and researcher

Triangulation: the investigation of a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives. This is mostly focused on verification and reliability of data rather than making up for the limitations of another type of methodology
1. Triangulation of data: data is drawn from different sources at different times/places/people
2. Investigator triangulation: different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data
3. Triangulation of theories: use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view data
4. Methodological triangulation: employ different data gathering techniques

### 3 Methods for Data Recording
1. Notes + Photographs -> least technical and most flexible way of recording data, but can be difficult to capture the right highlights.
2. Audio + Photographs -> less intrusive than video, allows observers to focus on the activity rather than on trying to capture every spoken word.
3. Video -> highest fidelity. Things to keep in mind: 1) whether to fix cam position or use a roving recorder 2) where to point the camera 3) understanding the imapct of the recording on the participants

### Interviews
> A conversation with a purpose

Good for exploring issues, learning more about tasks, and getting inside user's head.

Criteria for good interview:
    -   Before:
        -   get questions right → should support goals, should be easy to understand/answer
        -   be organized → check equipment, have necessary docs
        -   run pilots
    -   During:
        -   structure time
        -   give participants context
        -   use props and visuals → easier to show than tell
    -   Listen well throughout!

1. Open-ended/unstructured -> exploratory and similar to conversation. Can be time-consuming but can also produce rich insights
2. Semi-structured -> plans basic script with both closed and open questions but probes interviewee until no new relevants info is there
3. Structured -> predetermined questions like a questionnaire, study is standardized (same questions with each participant)
4. Group interviews -> 3-10 people selected to provide a representative sample of the target population. Useful for investigating shared issues rather than individual experiences

Asking questions like "Can you tell me a bit more about..." is called probing

#### Planning
When developing Interview Questions, keep in mind open questions are best suited where the goal of the session is exploratory; closed questions are best suited where the possible answers are known in advance. Break long or compound questions into separate questions

A lot of decisions to make:
- Choosing a framework
- Level of participation to adopt
- How to make a record of the data
- How to gain acceptance into the group being studied
- How to ensure that the study uses difference perspectives

Ethnography: the description of the customs of people and cultures. A distinguishing feature of ethnographic studies compared with other data gathering is that a situation is observed without imposing any a priori structure or framework upon it, and everything is viewed as "strange".

| Technique | Good for | Kind of Data | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| Interviews | Exploring issues | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Interviewer can guide, encourages contact between researchers and users | Artificial environment might be intimidating, remove them from usual environment |
| Focus Groups | Collecting multiple viewpoints | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Highlight areas of agreement/conflict, encourages contact between researchers and users | Possibility of dominant characters |
| Questionnaires | Answering specific questions | Quantitative and Qualitative | Can reach many people with low resource requirements | Design is key, response rates may be low |
| Direct observation in the field | Understanding context of user activity | Mostly qualitative | Observational insights | Very time-consuming, huge amounts of data |
| Direct observation in a controlled environment | Captural detail of individuals | Quantitative and qualitative | User can focus on task without interruption | Data may be of limited use due to artificial environment |
| Indirect observation | Observing users in natural environment without distraction | Quantitative (logging) and qualitative (diary) | Can be long due to automative recording | Large amounts of data implies need for tools to support analysis, participants may exaggerate memories |

#### Running the interview
Before starting, make sure that the goals of the interview have been explained to the interviewee and that they are willing to proceed. Listen more than talk, repond with sympathy but without bias, and to appear to enjoy the interview.

1.  **Intro**
    -   interviewer introduces themselves
    -   explain why you're doing the interview
    -   reassure interviewee re: ethical issues
    -   ask interviewee if they mind being recorded
2.  **Warm-up session**
    -   easy, nonthreatening questions
3.  **Main session**
    -   questions presented in logical sequence
    -   probing questions at the end
    -   order may vary in semi-structured interview
4.  **Cooling-off period**
    -   easy questions to defuse any tension
5.  **Closing session**
    -   interviewer thanks interviewee
    -   switch off recorder or put notebook away

### Observation
Users may be observed directly by the investigator as they perform their activities or indirectly through records of the activity that are studied afterward.

Observation can also result in a lot of data to sift through and can be complicated to do well than at firs appreciated. As such, a clearly stated goal is important to have focus for an observation session.

Example frameworks:
- The person: Who is using the technology at any particular time?
- The place: Where are they using it?
- The thing: What **are they doing with it?

3 common approaches
1. Simple observation: user is given a task, the evaluator just watches. This gives no insight into users' decision process
2. Think aloud: 
3. Co-discovery learning

## CPSC [344](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-344/current-term/) Ethics Code
- no contentious questions
- no offensive materials
- all subjects will be competent and over 19 (UBC students 17 and over can also be considered emancipated for the studies)
  - individuals who can fully understand what they are consenting to; and
  - individuals who are not vulnerable in any way relative to the student researchers.
- no public display of identifiable subject images

Consent will be obtained explicitly in one of the following ways:
1. by returning a completed questionnaire (questionnaireonly consent)
2. through the participant signing a consent form (general consent), or
3. by replying affirmatively to an email that contains the consent form text (general consent).
