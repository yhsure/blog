## Intro
A personal [digital garden](posts/digital-gardening.md) and hub for all my ramblings and thoughts. This is the index page so that the library is *somewhat* useful to all of you random internet strangers.

> [A library without an index](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/knowledge-compendia/485507/) becomes paradoxically [less informative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel) as it grows. -- Jorge Luis Borges

You can search my entire garden by pressing `/` or hitting the little search icon in the top left.
