Information Science: the world of recorded information produced by human agency. The study of how humans produce, seek, store, retrieve, and use information.

## Information
> Information is a thing that conveys meaning about stuff, transmitted from one place to another.

Characteristics
* Truthfulness: information is correct
* Aboutness: tells us about something else
* Thingness: information is a thing, although perhaps intangible

The study of information in and of itself is a research area too, through [education and epistemology](toc/education-and-epistemology.md)

### w.r.t. Power

As information becomes more abundant and saturated in our world, has information been any more of less important/necessary? We may have access to more of it, but it’s not obvious that this is better—just different.

> While technology has changed the volume, pace, and sources of information in our daily lives, it has not changed its essential power to shape our knowledge and our behavior in the world.

Information fuels discovery. It enables us to build off of each others work, and accomplish more than what a [single person could](posts/collaborative-thinking.md).

Information organizes us. The models of thinking and computation (e.g. numbering system) affect how we think about the world writ large and forms the basis for the computational systems which we interact with daily.

Information regulates us. The law, in its codified and written forms, encodes great injustices and inequities through dictating what rights are and who gets them.

Information identifies us. Each of us leave informational foot prints as we live our lives through documents, interactions, and conversations.


Contrary to Marshall McLuhan’s famous phrase, "the medium is the message", it seems as if the vast majority of the power from information is derived from its meaning and context rather than its medium or method of transmission.

## The Information Professions: Knowledge, memory, heritage
[Source](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1060508.pdf)

The traditional view of disciplines is that they lie on a spectrum where the study of arts and humanities (disciplines of the cultural record) lie on one end and mathematics and physical sciences on the other (the sciences of information). I'm not sure I fully agree with this, I think the pursuit of knowledge and truth in physical sciences ties very well with the pursuit of documentation within the cultural record and humanities. It would be more of a circle than a spectrum.

Bates proposes *meta-disciplines* which study the entire spectrum and how they fit together.

Examples of these include information disciplines, communication/journalism, and education.

The fundamental engine of development of this field of information professions is need. 

> Human beings want to retain informational resources, and, after a very short time, these resources collect at such a rate that some principles of selection, organization, etc., need to be brought to bear, in order for the resources to continue to be available for effective use.

3 information flow lineages through the history of life on Earth
1. Genetic, information about the history of life on Earth is literally encoded in your DNA
2. Neural-cultural, information is passed down between generations through language, storytelling, and sharing
3. Exosomatic, information is embedded into the world around us through writing, digital systems, desire paths, etc.
4. Residue, trace/abandoned information degrading back into nature

> The storage and management of exosomatic information was one of the major contributors to the exponential growth of human knowledge and power over nature.

## Praxis
The process in which ideas and theories are realized or embodied as action.

The argument is that all professions are mixtures of theory and practice. If a job is so simple that it is just a series of steps to carry out (algorithmic), then it is not a profession (counterpoint: can everything be reduced into algorithmic steps? How concrete do the steps need to be?). 

Thus, Bates distinguishes between discipline (theory) and profession (practice).

## Organizing Systems
_Organizing System_: an intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions they support
