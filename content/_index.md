Welcome to my little [garden](posts/networked-thought.md) on the [internet](thoughts/Internet.md) -- I'm Jacky! I spend a lot of time here cultivating and building things I find interesting. It's a little unkempt in places, but the I think it gives it a little charm.

A little more about me: I love [playing](posts/play.md), [[thoughts/writing|writing]], and [building out in the open](thoughts/building%20in%20public.md). I spend a lot of time creating and [[thoughts/maintenance|maintaining]] a number of open-source [projects](thoughts/Projects.md). I'm curious about how we can better [incentivize](thoughts/incentives.md) [public goods](thoughts/public%20goods.md) [funding](thoughts/funding.md), support better [interactions](thoughts/interaction%20design.md) with computers and [[thoughts/Rhizome Proposal|data]], and be more responsible stewards of technology. In this era of my life, I'm working towards being someone who is [unabashedly excited and curious about the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khfe3jBuq8c&list=PLMs_JcuNozJbxC91R5skgPpL7cnJuICun).

Before you go, I wanted to leave a few sign-posts while you digitally wander throughout this garden:
- [A collection of some of my favourite writing](/posts)
* [Things I've tinkered with and hacked on](thoughts/Projects.md)
- [Places I've worked at](thoughts/Experience.md)
* [A failure resume](posts/a-failure-resume.md)
* [What I've been reading](/books)

I hope you enjoy your time here! Feel free to stay as long as you'd like.
