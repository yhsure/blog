Welcome!
```

I'm Andreas. This is my little [[thoughts/hypertext|hypertext]] [[posts/networked-thought|garden]] on the [[thoughts/Internet|Internet]] -- make yourself at home!

Currently, I'm exploring what [[thoughts/agency|agentic]] and [[posts/agentic-computing|communal]] technology looks like at [Replit](https://replit.com/) and through my [independent research practice](/tags/rhizome). How might we create infrastructures and technologies that empower the residents of the web to have access to the same tools as the architects?

On a broader level, I care deeply about creating _[spaces](https://lu.ma/playspace)_ that enable others to have more [[thoughts/agency]]: agency to ask questions without judgement; agency to do what they are intrinsically drawn toward; agency to [[thoughts/play|play]] (because what's the point if we can't have a bit of fun?).

As far as 'about' pages go, I hope this acts as an open invitation into the many winding paths throughout this garden. Here are some places you may want to visit:

- [The oak letter desk](/posts/): a collection of my favourite [[thoughts/writing|writing]];
- [The hand-crafted workbench](thoughts/craft.md): craft I am proud of (websites, talks, workshops, projects, etc.);
- [The bookshelf on the far wall](/books): books that are in some state of read, being read, or to be read.
