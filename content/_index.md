Hi, I'm Jacky and welcome to my little digital garden! Here, I play with ideas through both code and words. Read more about my [non-work endeavours](/notwork) or my [failure resume](/posts/a-failure-resume).

I'm still trying to figure out what I really want to do with my life but 3 things that are fascinating to me right now are cognitive systems, ethical tech, and infrastructure. You can find more about what I'm thinking about on my [second brain](/toc/directory).

I strongly believe that **code can't abstract responsibility away from problems**. I spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve hackathon culture as a part of [nwPlus](https://www.nwplus.io/) and how to use technology ethically to make our world better with [Reboot](https://twitter.com/reboot_hq/) and [Interact](https://twitter.com/joininteract).

I'm working towards being a person who is [unabashedly excited about the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khfe3jBuq8c&list=PLMs_JcuNozJbxC91R5skgPpL7cnJuICun) and enables others to be the best versions of themselves. If anything in here piques your interest, let's find a time to chat! It's a magical world out there, it'd be a shame to explore it alone.
