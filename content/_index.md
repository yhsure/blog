Welcome to my little island on the internet -- I'm Jacky! I spend a lot of time here cultivating and building things I find interesting. This is my personal [digital garden](posts/networked-thought.md) and [organizing system](thoughts/organizing%20system.md) of sorts.

I love playing, tinkering, and building out in the open. I've built a number of open-source [projects](thoughts/Projects.md) over the past few years focused around tooling and [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md). I'm curious about how we can better incentivize [public goods](thoughts/public%20goods.md) [funding](thoughts/funding.md), support better [interactions](thoughts/interaction%20design.md) with computers, and be more responsible stewards of technology.

I'm working towards being a person who is [unabashedly excited and curious about the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Khfe3jBuq8c&list=PLMs_JcuNozJbxC91R5skgPpL7cnJuICun). If anything in here piques your interest, let's find a time to chat! It's a magical world out there and it'd be a shame to explore it alone.

A few link-gifts for you before you leave:
- [Things I've been writing about](/posts)
* [Things I've tinkered with](thoughts/Projects.md)
- [Places I've worked at](thoughts/Experience.md)
* [Things that didn't quite turn out right](posts/a-failure-resume.md)

Enjoy your time here, feel free to stay as long as you'd like and I hope to see you around!
