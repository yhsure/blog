Hi, I'm Jacky and welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm interested in infrastructure (both community and software), cognitive systems, and ethical tech. Currently, I'm based in Vancouver, Canada and studying Computer Science @ubc. I also help organize hackathons as a part of @nwplus.

In my spare time, you can find me faffing around on the climbing wall, writing half-baked thoughts on my blog, or reading in a park somewhere! Read more about my non-work-endeavours or my failure resume.

Feel free to download my resume, poke around my GitHub, or reach out to me on Twitter!
