  * too much context switching

## What I love doing
  * learn cool new stuff
  * solve problems
  * SHIP STUFF
  * amazing community
  * independence, ability to lead

## Must haves
* intellectually challenging
  * does the work challenge how I think?
  * will i get to deep dive and do focused work on certain topics?
  * am i learning new things?
* tight feedback loop: [feedback-loops](/thoughts/feedback-loops)
  * are there mechanisms to tell me if I'm doing well or not?
  * is feedback immediate, present, and clear?
* creative freedom
  * do i get freedom to choose (at least in part) what I work on?
* being able to share my work with others: [building-in-public](/thoughts/building-in-public)
  * fun team to work with
  * can i tell my family and friends what i do without shame
  * are real people going to be using what i build?
* balance
  * can I afford to take this on without compromising my ability to pay rent and tuition?
  * do I have still have personal time to just enjoy life?
