[Blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md) with a built-in Turing-complete programming language to allow individuals to write smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) which dictate their own rules around ownership, trasnaction formats, and state transition functions.

Ether (ETH) is the actual currency. All transactions (sending ETH, using a dApp, executing a smart contract) cost a gas fee to disincentivize bad actors from spamming.

Currently uses [proof-of-work](thoughts/proof-of-work.md) but soon to switch to [proof-of-stake](thoughts/proof-of-stake.md).

## dApps
Combine smart contracts (the backend) with a frontend user interface. Typically,
- open-source
- public data + records
- uses a cryptographic token to keep the network secure
