- Tradition, Discipline, Honor, and Excellence
- He seeks to inspire the boys to love poetry not because of some misguided sense of “objective” greatness, but because poetry elicits passion for life.
	- First, they should act on their impulses, “_Carpe Diem,_” by seizing the day. 
	- Second, he asserts that poetry’s purpose is to unveil human passion, and to move us to act more human by acting out on our passions.
- is their hedonism good? seeking pleasure vs seeking out what they want?
	- what if what they want is bad?
	- "Their romanticism is not a high striving after human excellence, but a low indulgence of their base appetites."
- schoolmasters also bad
	- "They are oligarchs hyper-focused on prestige, not genuine aristocrats pursuing excellence."
- both pursuing vanity (prestige) + hedonism (pleasure)
- ending life
- echoing my own life
