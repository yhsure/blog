## Boutique Search Engines
[Source](https://sariazout.mirror.xyz/7gSSTJ96SEyvXeljymglO3zN4H6DCgVnrNZq8_2NX1A)

We've returned to the *curated web* with Notion, Airtable, and Readwise collections, yet we haven't found good ways to make them multiplayer.

Still thinking about this in the context of collaborative digital gardens (e.g. [Quartz](http://quartz.jzhao.xyz/))

> What started as a well-intentioned way to organize the world’s information has turned into a business focusing most of its resources on monetizing clicks to support advertisers rather than focusing on the search experience for people.

The big thing here is that horizontal/'universal search' sites like Google use the same interface to search everything, relying on natural language to decipher user intentions. Vertical search players like Yelp/Zillow filled the functionality and relevancy gaps by using more structured search formats appropriate to the medium.

Curation, when thought of in the context of sharing bite-sized, isolated bits in feed-like architectures, is predominantly about entertainment, not utility. **How do we move beyond the search bar in an [attention economy](thoughts/attention-economy.md)?**

But if we curate, who curates the currators? We then run into a meta-governance problem. Mirror's [Token Race](https://dev.mirror.xyz/dLLIq4Iebg5DLWJbOWa3sU6oQuwbogkmqPnz-ZbzPUg) appears to be a good start to answering this question.

### On Ads
When you monetize via ads, curation takes a backseat to featuring advertisers - there is just less digital real estate available to curate your own recommendations. This creates [trust](thoughts/trust.md) gaps between users and search engines.


## The search box versus the feed
intentional browsing vs being served by an algorithm

Is it possible to move away from the ‘feed’-based model of browsing the social internet?

> The “feed”–an archaic form of content consumption that is effectively just a direct visual manifestation of the data structure that powers it – is a medium that is effectively designed to be consumed alone. –Humphrey Obuobi

"I realized that the experience of research is exactly opposite to the way I usually often encounter information online. When you research a subject, you make a series of important decisions, not least what it is you want to research, and you make a commitment to spend time finding information that doesn’t immediately present itself. You seek out different sources that you understand may be biased for various reasons. The very structure of the library… allows for browsing and close attention. Nothing could be more different from the news feed, where these aspects of information—provenance, trustworthiness, or what the hell it’s even about—are neither internally coherent nor subject to my judgment. Instead this information throws itself at me in no particular order, auto-playing videos and grabbing me with headlines. And behind the scenes, it’s me who’s being researched."

transition from aggregator of information to oracle
pagerank -> rank literally whats relevant, asks the user to determine what info they wanna actually use
oracle -> tells you the 'right' answer

"The idea is that instead of searching for information in a vast list of web pages, users would ask questions and have a language model trained on those pages answer them directly. The approach could change not only how search engines work, but what they do—and how we interact with them"

epistemological question
Metzler and his colleagues are interested in a search engine that behaves like a human expert. It should produce answers in natural language, synthesized from more than one document, and back up its answers with references to supporting evidence, as Wikipedia articles aim to do.

## Does language dictate how we think about the world?
importance of vocabulary
do we need labels to discuss things
false dichotomies
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is true -- but the effects are far more pronounced for programming languages than for spoken languages.

The language you write code in ends up shaping huge parts of you worldview even when you're not programming (sapir-whorf, [language-of-thought](/thoughts/language-of-thought))
The best purpose of language in general, and programming languages in particular is to expand the domain of thinkable thoughts

The power of programming languages (and why you may want to learn them, even if not intent on building software) is that they let you get you hands dirty with building and using ur own abstractions. ([mindstorms](/thoughts/books/mindstorms), computation as a form of language, constructionism)
