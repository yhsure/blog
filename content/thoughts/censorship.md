How do we draw the line between an end product and infrastructure? How should infrastructure regulate usage on its platform (if at all)? Been thinking about AWS's decision to remove Parler recently and whether it was warranted for AWS to do so. At what level of infrastructure should something become a '[public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md)'? As more and more of our digital infrastructure is built out under private companies, does it change how we govern content on top of it?

The benefit of retroactive correction in some instances—imagine fixing a typographical error in the proportions of a recipe, or blocking out someone’s phone number shared for the purposes of harassment—should be contextualized against the prospect of systemic, chronic demands for revisions by aggrieved people or companies single-mindedly demanding changes that serve to eat away at the public record.
