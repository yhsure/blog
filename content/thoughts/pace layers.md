![Pace Layers image from Stewart Brand in The Clock of the Long Now](/thoughts/images/pace-layers.png)*The order of civilization. The fast layers innovate; the slow layers stabilize. The whole combines learning with continuity.*

Coined by Stewart Brand in 1999.

The six Pace Layer levels in descending order from the highest & fastest to the lowest & slowest are Fashion, Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, Culture, Nature.

## Physics (and trust) as a new pace layer
Proposing a layer even below nature: physics. This are the axioms of the universe that seem unchanging (at least in the real world) but are actually configurable in the digital. (see: [Lattice](https://twitter.com/latticexyz))

[Trust](thoughts/trust.md) is enabled through consistent accessibility
-   You can't trust if you don't know if something will be available
-   Thus [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md) is a means of enabling trust, re: trusting objects and [Extended Mind Hypothesis](thoughts/Extended%20Mind%20Hypothesis.md)
-   physics has infinite availability
-   legitimacy is a pattern of higher order acceptance (vitalik)
-  blockchains as digital physics (the bottom layer of trust)
