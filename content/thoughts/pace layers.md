![Pace Layers image from Stewart Brand in The Clock of the Long Now](/thoughts/images/pace-layers.png)*The order of civilization. The fast layers innovate; the slow layers stabilize. The whole combines learning with continuity.*

Coined by Stewart Brand in 1999.

The six Pace Layer levels in descending order from the highest & fastest to the lowest & slowest are Fashion, Commerce, Infrastructure, Governance, Culture, Nature.

Proposing a layer even below nature: physics. This are the axioms of the universe that seem unchanging (at least in the real world) but are actually configurable in the digital. (see: [Lattice](https://twitter.com/latticexyz))
