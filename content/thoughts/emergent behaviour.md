How complex behaviour can arise out of seemingly simple rules? Is there anything special that causes emergent behaviour?
* Ant simulations
* Mold simulations
* [Community](/thoughts/communities) dynamics

Interesting to think about in context of single agents in multi-agent systems. How does [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) arise? Is it just because of the rules itself (a [reductionist](thoughts/Reductionism.md) approach) or is there something larger at play?

[Gall's law](thoughts/Gall's%20law.md): simple alphabets produce behaviors. Even simple rules like Conway's game of life can be Turing Complete!

How does this fit into low [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) communication?
