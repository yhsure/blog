## Tight feedback Loops
[Source](https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/)

-  noise in social media
    -  used to be a town square → hear what you hear
    -  radio bar model → everyone has a frequency people chose their frequency (substack model)
    -  competing on substack vs rolling your own

"Focusing on tight feedback also leads to getting stuck in local maxima. The short turnaround time leads to the pursuit of incremental improvements. Accurate feedback reduces error, but this means reaching and staying at the local maximum. The more accurate and more rapid the loop, the more quickly you’ll arrive at the top of the hill – and the less chance you have of leaving it to climb the mountains of mastery."

"This is because feedback loops which are too short for the overall system makes people focus on inappropriate intermediate goals."
* dangers of intermediate proxies?
* what about in machine learning? using certain quantities for metrics which are just *proxies* for more difficult to measure qualitative end goals
