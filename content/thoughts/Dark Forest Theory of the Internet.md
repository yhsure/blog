> Imagine a dark forest at night. It’s deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it’s not. The dark forest is full of life. It’s quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.

## Cozy Web
It's unsafe to reveal yourself to them in any authentic way. So we retreat into private spaces. We hide in the **cozy web.** Ephemeral content is the content in the dark forest. Fireflies not lamps.

"These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments."

In these cases, the specific context and audience is well-defined. More users are also turning to 'finstas' which are accounts focused for a closed group of friends and family rather than the entire public [internet](thoughts/Internet.md).

How can we create [digital mindfulness](thoughts/digital%20mindfulness.md) in communication and conversation?

## Handmade Web
From J.R. Carpenter's [*A Handmade Web*](http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html)

> I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or [[thoughts/identity|identity]].
