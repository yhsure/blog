-   social graph → who's connected to who
-   interest graph → online representations of interests
-   constructing interest graphs from social graphs
    -   traditional social media apps like facebook/ig
-   constructing social graphs from interest graphs
    -   more 'live' apps like tiktok
-   social graph as infrastructure?
    -   should we make one centralized social structure and platforms can then build platforms off of that social graph?
    -   china does this well
-   focus on being end product rather than infrastructure layer that others build on top of
-   "a platform is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value of the company that creates it. then it's a platform"
-   "achieving product-market-fit of social is the intersection of a feature and a graph"
    -   people keep copying each others features
    -   but if the underlying graph is different, the intersection might be different too
-   search directed vs feed directed networks
    -   [https://outline.com/ZhCArb](https://outline.com/ZhCArb) → future of search?
    -   why feeds exist → more supply than eyeballs to consume it, someone needs to make a decision on what you actually see (no chronological feeds anymore)

if [cities are not top-down hierarchies](city-is-not-a-tree.md), then are social graphs a better way to think about them?
