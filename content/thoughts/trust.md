> In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a fearful society; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.

Having clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.

This feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Not only is **access** important, but how easily people understand why it works.

Curious whether this has relations to [philosophy of science](thoughts/philosophy%20of%20science.md) and [Cartesian skepticism](thoughts/Descartes'%20Meditations.md)

"Because [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md)s allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, **and because the record itself is shared** across all participants, there is a whole new "trust space" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions."

## Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude
*C. Thi Nguyen*

"We inhabit trust like we inhabit the air, and we only notice it when it has departed."

> Most theories of trust presume that trust is a conscious attitude that can be directed at only other agents. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is not simply to rely on something, but to rely on it unquestioningly. It is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability

### Baier's Goodwill Theory
Colloquial use of "trust" blurs together two very distinct concepts
- Mere reliance: depending on something
- Attitude of trust: depend in some more normatively loaded manner
	- E.g. failing to show up after having promised to do so: "I had trusted you and you let me down"
	- Generally applies to things/people within our integrative stance -- things we take to be part of us and towards things with which we are supposed to be integrating to form some larger whole
	- The normativity here arises, not from there being any moral commitments in play, but from teleological integration: "The external objects that evoke the strongest sense of betrayal are those whose functions are most tightly integrated into our own thinking and functioning"

Question: can objects be trusted in the normative sense? Can we feel betrayed by objects?

This involves ascribing goodwill to the trusted and the sense of betrayal comes from discovery that there is no such goodwill after all.

### Responsiveness Theories
Thinking that the fact that you trust in them/it will give a reason to fulfill that trust.

> a trustworthy person “takes the fact that they are counted on to be a reason for acting as counted on” (Jones 2012, 66)

Betrayal of trust here is failure to be properly responsive

Hawley's definition of trust is that "to trust somebody is to take them to have made a commitment to do something and to rely on them to fulfill that commitment. Hawley's account grounds the sence of betrayal in the trusted person's failure to live up to their commitments"

### Non-agent based theories
Yet all of these theories share the presumption of agent-directedness or [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md).

> "The veteran also suffers from a problem of trust, a building block on which all of social life is erected. The everyday, taken-for-granted reality of civilian life ignores much; civility assumes the nonlethal intentions of others. In war, however, all such assumptions evaporate: one cannot trust the ground one walks on, the air one breathes, nor can one expect with full assuredness that tomorrow will come again." (Kearl 1989, 353)

> The fact that many philosophers find it odd to speak of being betrayed by their environment is perhaps best explained by the fact that most philosophers have lead, by and large, pretty cushy lives.

Interesting to distinguish between what we are trusting when we trust designed (e.g. search engines, devices, websites, etc.) and non-designed objects (the ground, physics, etc.)

To lose trust is to shift from the unquestioning state to the endlessly skeptical and suspicious mood.
