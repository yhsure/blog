Having clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.

This feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Not only is **access** important, but how easily people understand why it works.

"Because [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md)s allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, **and because the record itself is shared** across all participants, there is a whole new "trust space" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions."
