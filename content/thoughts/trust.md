Having clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.

This feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Not only is **access** important, but how easily people understand why it works.

Curious whether this has relations to [philosophy of science](thoughts/philosophy%20of%20science.md) and [Cartesian skepticism](thoughts/Descartes'%20Meditations.md)

"Because [blockchain](thoughts/blockchain.md)s allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, **and because the record itself is shared** across all participants, there is a whole new "trust space" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions."

## Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude
*C. Thi Nguyen*

"We inhabit trust like we inhabit the air, and we only notice it when it has departed."

> Most theories of trust presume that trust is a conscious attitude that can be directed at only other agents. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is not simply to rely on something, but to rely on it unquestioningly. It is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability

### Baier's Goodwill Theory
Colloquial use of "trust" blurs together two very distinct concepts
- Mere reliance: depending on something
- Attitude of trust: depend in some more normatively loaded manner
	- E.g. failing to show up after having promised to do so: "I had trusted you and you let me down"
	- Generally applies to things/people within our integrative stance -- things we take to be part of us and towards things with which we are supposed to be integrating to form some larger whole
	- The normativity here arises, not from there being any moral commitments in play, but from teleological integration: "The external objects that evoke the strongest sense of betrayal are those whose functions are most tightly integrated into our own thinking and functioning"

Question: can objects be trusted in the normative sense? Can we feel betrayed by objects?

This involves ascribing goodwill to the trusted and the sense of betrayal comes from discovery that there is no such goodwill after all.

### Responsiveness Theories
Thinking that the fact that you trust in them/it will give a reason to fulfill that trust.

> a trustworthy person “takes the fact that they are counted on to be a reason for acting as counted on” (Jones 2012, 66)

Betrayal of trust here is failure to be properly responsive

Hawley's definition of trust is that "to trust somebody is to take them to have made a commitment to do something and to rely on them to fulfill that commitment. Hawley's account grounds the sence of betrayal in the trusted person's failure to live up to their commitments"

### Non-agent based theories
Yet all of these theories share the presumption of agent-directedness or [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md).

> "The veteran also suffers from a problem of trust, a building block on which all of social life is erected. The everyday, taken-for-granted reality of civilian life ignores much; civility assumes the nonlethal intentions of others. In war, however, all such assumptions evaporate: one cannot trust the ground one walks on, the air one breathes, nor can one expect with full assuredness that tomorrow will come again." (Kearl 1989, 353)

> The fact that many philosophers find it odd to speak of being betrayed by their environment is perhaps best explained by the fact that most philosophers have lead, by and large, pretty cushy lives.

Interesting to distinguish between what we are trusting when we trust designed (e.g. search engines, devices, websites, etc.) and non-designed objects (the ground, physics, etc.)

To lose trust is to shift from the unquestioning state to the endlessly skeptical and suspicious mood.

## Partiality and prejudice in trusting
*By Katherine Hawley*

> Is it reasonable to trust your [friends](thoughts/friendship.md)?

Common definition of trust:
- involves relying on them to do it
- an extra factor which distinguishes genuine trust from the attitude of mere reliance we take to inanimate objects

Interestingly, there is a gap between relying on someone to do something and believing that they will do it
- Trust is a choice -- so "trusting someone to do something need not involve belief that she is trustworthy, nor belief that she will do what she is trusted to do, nor even belief that it is likely she will do it"
- You can trust someone to do something without relying on them to do it
	- I can trust my friends to keep my secrets by not believing that they *won't* keep my secrets
- You can rely on them without trusting them
	- I can rely on my neighbour to tidy the garden we share but I don't trust her to do so (nor distrust) -- I would feel disappointed but not resentful if she didn't do the job
Trust doesn't require *active knowledge* -- checking whether $x$ will $p$ is unnecessary when I already *know* whether $x$ will $p$

Stroud (2006) and Kelly (2004) argue that we *should* have partiality towards friends not only in actions but beliefs as well, though this isn't always the right thing to do. As Stroud says, 'friendship requires epistemic irrationality'
- Confirmation [bias](thoughts/bias.md): tendency to notice evidence which confirms our existing beliefs (that our friends are indeed good people)
- May resist bad news that undermines a shared history of friendship (sunk cost fallacy)
	- "should we quietly drop the friend, provoke a confrontation, or accept a continuing friendship contaminated with doubts?"

The considerations are all in some sense selfish—they play on our wish to be right, to have been right, to be a good judge of character, and to avoid difficult situations.

Exploring potential conflicts between different types of trust
1. Epistemic Trust: trust in someone as a speaker or source of knowledge
2. Practical Trust: trust in someone as an actor

In fact, there is often a two-way causal interaction between friendship and trustworthiness. Roughly, people are more likely to behave in a trust-worthy manner towards their friends, and we are more likely to form friendships with people we consider trustworthy. Clearly, there are exceptions
1. Friend might let you down instead of disappointing someone else as your friend hopes you will understand and forgive them
2. Might find it more tempting to lie about some matters because they are concerned about maintaining a good image of themselves in your mind
But if she takes these liberties too often, you will feel you have been taken for granted, and come to resent your friend. **Friendship requires mutual respect and openness as well as forgiveness.**

Stroud's 4 demands of friendship
1. Serious scrutiny: scrutinize negative claims about our friends
2. Different conclusions: draw different conclusions and make difference inferences than they otherwise would about non-friends given the same information
3. Interpretive Charity: interpret evidence against friends more charitably than with non-friends
4. Reason: treat the fact someone is a friend as a reason when we believe about them
