> Trust is only meaningful once we have fully understood how people can lie.

Having clearly defined and encoded rules means that there is an *implicit shift* from trusting those who own the medium to those who are transacting. In essense, trusting peers rather than a regulatory power.

This feels like its missing an important step in the process: trusting the medium. If people don't understand how the medium works to facilitate transactions, how can they trust it? Not only is **access** important, but how easily people understand why it works.

> To dream up important ideas you must think like an idealist; to build systems that will live up to those dreams, you must think like an adversary.
