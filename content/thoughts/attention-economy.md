Attention as a commodity, it is increasingly competitive to compete for everyone's attention
* shortening of attention spans? not sure if this is an actual thing
* 'digital detox'

> Instead of having sequential conferences on bulletin boards like The Well where you would take hours to **craft a response** to something, we ended up with a digital space where we were constantly being interrupted [...] We end up in this state of constant emergency interruption which I don't think is healthy neurologically or culturally.

This is an opportunity for us to reclaim our attention, to *properly* build out asynchronous experiences so that people can work in their own time rather than the rushed, [ephemereal content](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md) we're so used to now.

"I don't want a job - I want my basic needs fulfilled and a degree of comfort and security which will enable me to make a meaningful contribution. Jobs are an artifact of the industrial age and a certain way of existing in time." Jobs are just the societally accepted norm for fulfilling basic needs. (Bullshit Jobs)

Side note: people who [introduce](thoughts/introductions.md) themselves by talking about their job make me feel really weird. You're just describing the means you take the keep yourself alive -- what are the ends? What makes you *feel* alive?
