## Design Process
This is *different* from the [double diamond-design](thoughts/double-diamond-design.md) model.

1.  Pre design: **understand** the problem
    -   do users really have the problem you think they do?
    -   who are the users? (think expertise, abilities, priorities, needs etc)
    -   who cares? (what non-users are involved in the problem/solution?)
    -   what is the task? (what are they _really_ trying to do, and what is getting in the way?)
    -   Evaluation: ethnography, observation, interviews, focus groups, questionnaires, surveys
2.  Early design: **explore** design space
    -   consider approaches
    -   consider important metrics for different approaches and high-risk elements
    -   Evaluation: interviews, focus groups, observation, questionnaries, surveys, contextual inquiry + work modeling, task analysis, task / cognitive walktrhoughs, participatory design, heuristic evaluation
3.  Mid design: **develop** chosen approach
    -   confirm chosen approach
    -   reduce risk
    -   consider user input needed to verify design progress and prototypes necessary for problem-solving
    -   Evaluation: observation, interviews, questionnaires, surveys, heuristic evaluation, formal performance/usability testing
4.  Late design: integrate and start to **deploy**
    -   field-test: put system is real users' hands in real contexts
    -   fine-tune and debug

In this model, iteration is the key features. Needs and motivations are diverse and complex, it's extremely hard to perfectly predict or model context, how people want to do their task, or how it will break down

### Reality
However in reality, this isn't always the "ideal". We need to deal with
- deadlines and budget limit
- challenges to involve the right users at the right time
- direct users may not be the only one affected by the system (consider other stakeholders)

Stakeholders are anyone who has some reason to care about the interface (who may or may not have conflicting needs)
-   direct users: convenience, functionality
-   manager of direct users: work efficiency, cost efficiency
-   developer: ease of development â€” deadlines, budget
-   manufacturer: cost of production
-   advertiser: visibility

To find these people, the question you need to ask is "who will make your life miserable if they don't like it?"
