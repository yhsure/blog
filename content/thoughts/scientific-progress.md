Has the scientific culture of being wrong now vs a few hundred years ago changed? Would Einstein survive in the modern age? Probably not.

Hypothesizing that this is leading to small incremental changes rather than monumental new theories/original work from being developed.

People get too attached to their theories. (e.g Planck and Einstein)

## Sleeping Beauties
The "sleeping beauty" of science papers are papers that are dormant for 10 years then have a lot of citations.

Usually indicative of work that was too 'out there' or didn't align with existing incentive structures/measures of success when it was first published and got burried, only to be 're-discovered' down the line.

## Karl Popper
The aim of scientific inquiry is to find the truth. Yet, some of the greatest scientific theories in the history of science are actually false (e.g. early models of the atom, Newtonian physics). 

Closeness to the truth is a function of two factors
1. Truth
2. Content

Thus, the more truths a theory entails, the closer it is to the truth.

> Even two true theories can have differing degrees of verisimilitude, depending on how much true information they deliver. For example, the claim "it will be raining on Thursday next week," if true, seems closer to the truth than the true yet logically weaker claim "it will either be raining next Thursday or it will be sunny".

Similarly, the concept of a [lie-to-children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children): creating a simplified world model to explain a system because the real one is too complex to grasp
