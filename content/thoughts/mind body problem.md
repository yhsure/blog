Concerned with how the mind and body are connected to one another
-   are we just entirely made up of matter or is there something more?
-   two points of doubt
	-   we know a bit about minds without knowing anything about brains
	-   are minds different from brains
	-   not true, they still might be the same thing

Approaches
-   materialism (physicalism) → minds and brains are identical (identity theory)
    -   nothing magical about minds, just the brains activity
-   dualism → minds are distinct from the brain
-   idealism → everything is mental/in the mind

## Considering other minds
-   for own mind → introspection works, more or less
-   for other minds → must rely on behaviour of others (what they say and do)
-   two possible ways of understanding how this way of knowing other minds works
    -   behaviourism → behaviour is all there is to mentality
        -   seems inconsistent w introspection
        -   we have thoughts that are never reflected in our behaviour
        -   can have multiple thoughts that correspond with a behaviour → umbrella example
            -   a man looks out of a window, goes to a closet and takes an umbrella before leaving his house
            -   what is he thinking?
            -   there are multiple possible thoughts that could've lead to his taking the umbrella
    -   common-sense psychology (C-SP) -> understand most likely correct interpretation
        -  common-sense knowledge of other minds rests on knowledge of some general principles of the characteristic behaviour of people
	        -   He sees pretty much what we see when we look.
            -   He doesn’t like most stuff that people don’t like (getting soaked).
            -   He minimizes costs when possible.
            -   In general, we attribute normal perceptual and reasoning abilities.
        -  "We attribute thoughts to him that it is reasonable for him to have, given those abilities."

## Causal pictures
-   thoughts are not directly perceivable, they lie behind and cause behaviour. as a result,
	1.  certain counterfactuals are true
		1.  if the thought never occurred, the behaviour would not have happened
	2.  thoughts _explain_ the behaviour
	3.  there are regularities (natural laws) that govern the connection
-   someone performs an action for a reason when their reason is a cause of their action
	-   A did B for a reason C when C caused A to do B
-   arguments for the causal picture
	-   when we try to explain why someone did something, only citing the causes seem adequate
-   arguments against the causal pictures
	-   some behaviours seem to be more than just a symptom or effect of inner factors like thoughts
