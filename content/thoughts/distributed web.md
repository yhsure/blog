The Distributed Web enables us to share content thatÂ **resist centralized forms of censorship**

Distributed Press uses [[thoughts/IPFS]] and [[thoughts/Hypercore]] as our initial content sharing protocols. In addition to the familiar https, you can view our published content using the ipfs and hypercore schemes on compatible browsers.
