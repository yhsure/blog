Worked a lot with Ruby, known for social justice work and activism. Transitioned in 2014.

- Contributor Covenenant
	- 2014
	- Helped promote widespread adoption of codes of conduct
- Post-Meritocracy
	- Meritocracy
		- "We hide behind the motto of “love the art, hate the artist” to justify our preferences despite the faint voice of conscience, persistent in telling us that something is amiss."
		- "One of the well-noted problems of adopting utility as the primary measure of morality is that it ignores the concept of justice, as cruel actions are condoned so long as they contribute to the greater good. Inequalities or injustices inflicted upon a minority are also deemed acceptable by this philosophy, so long as they do not interfere with the ability of the majority to experience pleasure." -- [[thoughts/To Live in their Utopia|To Live in their Utopia]]
		- Foolish to think we can make metrics and measure everything that's important.
			- "Measuring the final result doesn’t provide enough quantitative data, so it’s tempting to include the data from intermediate steps. This is an attempt to shorten the feedback loop, and trying to shorten feedback loops is very dangerous in complex systems." [Source](https://brianlui.dog/2020/05/10/beware-of-tight-feedback-loops/)
	- But meritocracy has consistently shown itself to mainly benefit those with privilege, to the exclusion of underrepresented people in technology
	- "We can add the most value as professionals by drawing on the diversity of our identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Homogeneity is an antipattern."
	- More than the work we do -- what would meritocracy look like in a post-work society?
	- We have an ethical responsibility to refuse to work on software that will negatively impact the well-being of other people: Good transition to Hippocratic license
- Being fired from GitHub
	- 2016
	- Worked on Repository Invitations (which I find a fantastic feature)
		- GitHub didn't like the tone, a male engineer completely rewrote it
	- Discourage mentorship which was weird
- [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/)
	- Software is [[thoughts/software and politics|political]]
	- "You can’t build systems that can be weaponized against marginalized people and take no responsibility for them."
	- an Ethical Source license that specifically prohibits the use of software to violate universal standards of human rights
- Opalgate
	- "meh went on to state that he would knowingly and gladly accept working with a child molestor or cross-burning racist as long as their contributed code was good"
- First-time contributor tag, good first issue, etc.
