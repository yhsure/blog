Worked a lot with Ruby, known for social justice work and activism. Transitioned in 2014.

- Contributor Covenenant
	- 2014
	- Helped promote widespread adoption of codes of conduct
- Post-Meritocracy
	- But meritocracy has consistently shown itself to mainly benefit those with privilege, to the exclusion of underrepresented people in technology
	- "We can add the most value as professionals by drawing on the diversity of our identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Homogeneity is an antipattern."
	- More than the work we do -- what would meritocracy look like in a post-work society?
	- We have an ethical responsibility to refuse to work on software that will negatively impact the well-being of other people: Good transition to Hippocratic license
- Being fired from GitHub
	- 2016
	- Worked on Repository Invitations (which I find a fantastic feature)
		- GitHub didn't like the tone, a male engineer completely rewrote it
	- Discourage mentorship which was weird
- [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/)
	- Software is [[thoughts/software and politics|political]]
	- "You canâ€™t build systems that can be weaponized against marginalized people and take no responsibility for them."
	- an Ethical Source license that specifically prohibits the use of software to violate universal standards of human rights
- Opalgate
	- "meh went on to state that he would knowingly and gladly accept working with a child molestor or cross-burning racist as long as their contributed code was good"
- First-time contributor tag, good first issue, etc.
