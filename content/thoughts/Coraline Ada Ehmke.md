Worked a lot with Ruby, known for social justice work and activism. Transitioned in 2014.

- Contributor Covenenant
	- 2014
	- Helped promote widespread adoption of codes of conduct
- Post-Meritocracy
	- But meritocracy has consistently shown itself to mainly benefit those with privilege, to the exclusion of underrepresented people in technology
	- "We can add the most value as professionals by drawing on the diversity of our identities, backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Homogeneity is an antipattern."
	- More than the work we do -- what would meritocracy look like in a post-work society?
	- We have an ethical responsibility to refuse to work on software that will negatively impact the well-being of other people: Good transition to Hippocratic license
- Being fired from GitHub
	- 2016
	- Worked on Repository Invitations (which I find a fantastic feature)
		- GitHub didn't like the tone, a male engineer completely rewrote it
	- Discourage mentorship which was weird
- [Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/)
	- Software is [[thoughts/software and politics|political]]
	- "You can’t build systems that can be weaponized against marginalized people and take no responsibility for them."
	- an Ethical Source license that specifically prohibits the use of software to violate universal standards of human rights
- Opalgate
	- "meh went on to state that he would knowingly and gladly accept working with a child molestor or cross-burning racist as long as their contributed code was good"
- First-time contributor tag, good first issue, etc.

Questions
- Deciding to work within a company vs outside of it
	- At what point do you leave?
- Sustainability of working outside of the context of a company
	- funding open source is hard
	- intersection of social justice work and open source, v prone to burn out
	- We can be successful while leading rich, full lives. Our success and value is not dependent on exerting all of our energy on contributing to software. (re: post-meritocracy)
		- Don't bring your whole self to work? Is this what this is saying
- 21:42 "I believe that as technologists we have a moral imperative to prevent our work from being used to harm others. Responsibility is about impact not intent. Freedom for freedom’s sake is incompatible with our responsibility to society." [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-WP9g4jCU0)
- Whether https://ethicalsource.dev/ is worth doing
	- ethics of AI/multiplicative technology
	- how would gating open source technology look like
- Early music streaming/torrent
- Building things into tech vs relying on policy
	- codifying/quantifying values in software -- is this possible
- Decentralization
