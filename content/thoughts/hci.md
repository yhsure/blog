> Better HCI is better empathy

What even is HCI?
* The human-machine joint performance of tasks
* Human-computer or human-human communicationmediated by computers

3 main goals of HCI
1. Designing
2. Implementing
3. Evaluating

## Design of Everyday Things
> "The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for signs, certainly without any need for trial and error."

Two of the most important characteristics of good design:
1. Discoverability: is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
2. Understanding: what does it all mean? How is the end product supposed to be used?

Covers three major areas of design
1. Industrial Design: creating/developing concepts and specs that optimize function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
2. Interaction Design: enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occured
3. Experience Design: practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

The machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. Humans, on the other hand, are imaginative and creative, filled with common sense. Yet, to interact with machines, they require us to be precise and accurate, things we are not very good at.

The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.

### tl;dr
1. Most failures of human-machine systems are due to poor designs rather than human error itself. 
3. Good design accounts of human limitations.

## Human Centered Design (HCD)
Putting human needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving first. This requires good understanding of human psychology, technology, and good communication (both person-to-person and person-to-machine).

> HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations.

### Discoverability
When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible.

This is composed up of 5 fundamental psychological concepts
1. **Affordances**:  signifies *what* action is possible. It is the relationship between the properties of an objects and the capabilities of the user that determine how the object could be used. For example, a chair affords ("is for") support and therefore affords sitting. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.
2. **Signifiers**: signifies *where* actions should occur. A mark, sound, or perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behaviour to a person. Can be a desire path, a push/pull label, etc.
3. **Constraints**: limits to the possible interactions with an object. For example, the different sized holes in a scissor suggests different numbers of fingers may fit in each hole and not any more.
4. **Mappings**: relationship between the elements of two sets of things. For example, a mapping of light switches to light bulbs or the steering wheel to the direction of the wheels. Groupings and proximity are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used to map controls to function: related controls should be grouped together. 
5. **Feedback**: communicating the results of an action or some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request. Has to be a balance, little and poor feedback and too much feedback can also be unhelpful and annoying to users. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.

Conceptual models are explanations (usually highly simplified) of how something works. These can be the desktop metaphor where files, folders, and icons help represent the model of data on the hard drive. We are concerned with mentally held conceptual models -- mental models.

Often times the designer's conceptual model, the system image (how it manifests in reality), and the user's conceptual model are not aligned.

## Double-Diamond Model of Design
Two main 'diamonds' of diverge-converge, one to find the right problem and the other to find the right solution (fulfilling human needs).

![Double-Diamond Model: Discover, define, develop, deliver](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Double_diamond.png)*Discover, define, develop, deliver*

The 4 basic activities for interaction design are as follows:
1. Discovering requirements (discover/define phase)
2. Designing alternatives (develop phase)
3. Prototyping alternative designs to be communicated and assessed (develop phase)
4. Evaluating the product and the UX it ofers (develop phase)

## Goals
### Usability Goals
Usability refers to esnuring that interactive products are easy to learn, effective to use, and enjoyable from the user's perspective. Following 6 goals:

1. Effective to use (effectiveness). Is the product capable of allowing people to learn ,carry out their work efficiently, access the information that they need, or buy the goods that they want?
2. Efficient to use (efficiency). Once users have learned how to use a product to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity?
3. Safe to use (safety). What is the range of errors that are possible using the product, and what measures are there to permit users to recover easily from them?
4. Having good utility (utility). Does the product provide an appropriate set of functions that will enable users to carry out all of their tasks in the way they want to do them?
5. Easy to learn (learnability). Is it possible for the user to work out how to use the product by exploring the interface and trying certain actions? How hard will it be to learn the whole set of functions in this way?
6. Easy to remember how to use (memorability). What types of interface support have been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for products and operations they use infrequently?

### User Experience Goals
Desirable aspects of UX
- Satisfying
- Enjoyable
- Helpful
- Fun
- Provocative

Undesirable aspects of UX
- Making one feel stupid or guilty
- Cutesy
- Gimmicky
- Frustrating

These are combined in a user's multi-faceted experience of a product

### Design Principles
Concerned with what users should see and do when carrying out their tasks using an interactive product: the dos and don'ts of interaction design.

1. High visibility: ensure functions are easy to find and intuitive.
2. Feedback: time sensitive information about what actions has been done and what has been accomplished.
3. Constraints: ways of restricting the user interaction to those which are valid in any given moment.
4. Consistency: an interface which follows rules, such as using the same operation to select all objects.
5. Affordance: attributes should obviously signal what they can use it for. Afford means "to give a clue"

The problem when applying these to real world is that trade-offs can arise between principles (e.g. increased constraint might mean less visibility).

## User Involvement
The underlying aim is to involve members of the public in helping them make a change in their lives where technology is often viewed as an integral part of the process. This is the point of [participatory design](thoughts/books/design-justice.md).

The main principles of user-centered design are as follows:
1. Early focus on users and tasks
2. Empirical measurement
3. Iterative design

Benefits:
1. Expectation management: ensuring that the users' expectations of the new product are realistic and no surprises for users when the product arrives.
2. Ownership: users who are involved and feel that they have contributed to a product's development are more likely to feel a sense of ownerships toward it and support its user

## Data Recording
- What is data? Anything that is useful for understanding a particular design, user needs, and user behaviour.
- What does it mean to collect user data? What techniques can be used, and how useful and reliable is the data that is collected?

Five Key Issues
1. Settings Goals. Goals will influence the nature of data gathering sessions, the data gathering techniques to be used, and the analysis to be performed.
2. Identifying Participants. Those who fit the profile of types of people from whom data can be gathered are called the study population. Types of sampling are as follows:
  - Probability Sampling: simple random sampling or stratified sampling
  - Nonprobability Sampling: convenience sampling or volunteer panels
    - Convenience Sampling: sample includes those who were available rather than those specifically selected
3. Relationship with Participants: informed consent with a clear and professional relationship between participant and researcher

Triangulation: the investigation of a phenomenon from at least two different perspectives. This is mostly focused on verification and reliability of data rather than making up for the limitations of another type of methodology
1. Triangulation of data: data is drawn from different sources at different times/places/people
2. Investigator triangulation: different researchers (observers, interviewers, and so on) have been involved in collecting and interpreting the data
3. Triangulation of theories: use of different theoretical frameworks through which to view data
4. Methodological triangulation: employ different data gathering techniques

### 3 Methods for Data Recording
1. Notes + Photographs -> least technical and most flexible way of recording data, but can be difficult to capture the right highlights.
2. Audio + Photographs -> less intrusive than video, allows observers to focus on the activity rather than on trying to capture every spoken word.
3. Video -> highest fidelity. Things to keep in mind: 1) whether to fix cam position or use a roving recorder 2) where to point the camera 3) understanding the imapct of the recording on the participants

### Interviews
> A conversation with a purpose

1. Open-ended/unstructured -> can be time-consuming but can also produce rich insights
2. Semi-structured -> plans basic script but probes interviewee until no new relevants info is there
3. Structured -> predetermined questions like a questionnaire, study is standardized
4. Group interviews -> 3-10 people selected to provide a representative sample of the target population. Useful for investigating shared issues rather than individual experiences

Asking questions like "Can you tell me a bit more about..." is called probing

#### Planning
1. Developing Interview Questions. Open questions are best suited where the goal of the session is exploratory; closed questions are best suited where the possible answers are known in advance. Break long or compound questions into separate questions
2. Running the Interview. Before starting, make sure that the goals of the interview have been explained to the interviewee and that they are willing to proceed. Listen more than talk, repond with sympathy but without bias, and to appear to enjoy the interview.

A lot of decisions to make too
- Choosing a framework
- Level of participation to adopt
- How to make a record of the data
- How to gain acceptance into the group being studied
- How to ensure that the study uses difference perspectives

Ethnography: the description of the customs of people and cultures. A distinguishing feature of ethnographic studies compared with other data gathering is that a situation is observed without imposing any a priori structure or framework upon it, and everything is viewed as "strange".

| Technique | Good for | Kind of Data | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --------- | -------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| Interviews | Exploring issues | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Interviewer can guide, encourages contact between researchers and users | Artificial environment might be intimidating, remove them from usual environment |
| Focus Groups | Collecting multiple viewpoints | Mostly qualitative (some quantitative) | Highlight areas of agreement/conflict, encourages contact between researchers and users | Possibility of dominant characters |
| Questionnaires | Answering specific questions | Quantitative and Qualitative | Can reach many people with low resource requirements | Design is key, response rates may be low |
| Direct observation in the field | Understanding context of user activity | Mostly qualitative | Observational insights | Very time-consuming, huge amounts of data |
| Direct observation in a controlled environment | Captural detail of individuals | Quantitative and qualitative | User can focus on task without interruption | Data may be of limited use due to artificial environment |
| Indirect observation | Observing users in natural environment without distraction | Quantitative (logging) and qualitative (diary) | Can be long due to automative recording | Large amounts of data implies need for tools to support analysis, participants may exaggerate memories |

#### Observation
Users may be observed directly by the investigator as they perform their activities or indirectly through records of the activity that are studied afterward.

Observation can also result in a lot of data to sift through and can be complicated to do well than at firs appreciated. As such, a clearly stated goal is important to have focus for an observation session.

Example frameworks:
- The person: Who is using the technology at any particular time?
- The place: Where are they using it?
- The thing: What are they doing with it?

## [344](https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-344/current-term/) Specific
- no contentious questions
- no offensive materials
- all subjects will be competent and over 19 (UBC students 17 and over can also be considered emancipated for the studies)
  - individuals who can fully understand what they are consenting to; and
  - individuals who are not vulnerable in any way relative to the student researchers.
- no public display of identifiable subject images
- no physical risks
- no highly personal/medical data
- no identifying data sent out of Canada, all data storage servers located in Canada

Consent will be obtained explicitly in one of the following ways:
1. by returning a completed questionnaire (questionnaireonly consent)
2. through the participant signing a consent form (general consent), or
3. by replying affirmatively to an email that contains the consent form text (general consent).

Human task involves the steps to do something, whereas human needs are general wants of the user, what they want to get accomplished.
