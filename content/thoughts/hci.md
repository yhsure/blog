What even is HCI?
* The human-machine joint performance of tasks
* Human-computer or human-human communicationmediated by computers

3 main goals of HCI
1. Designing
2. Implementing
3. Evaluating

## Design of Everyday Things
> "The design of the door should indicate how to work it without any need for signs, certainly without any need for trial and error."

Two of the most important characteristics of good design:
1. Discoverability: is it possible to even figure out what actions are possible and where and how to perform them?
2. Understanding: what does it all mean? How is the end product supposed to be used?

Covers three major areas of design
1. Industrial Design: creating/developing concepts and specs that optimize function, value, and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer
2. Interaction Design: enhance people's understanding of what can be done, what is happening, and what has just occured
3. Experience Design: practice of designing products, processes, services, events, and environments with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience

The machine does what it is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. Humans, on the other hand, are imaginative and creative, filled with common sense. Yet, to interact with machines, they require us to be precise and accurate, things we are not very good at.

The problem with the designs of most engineers is that they are too logical. We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be.

## Human Centered Design (HCD)
Putting human needs, capabilities, and ways of behaving first. This requires good understanding of human psychology, technology, and good communication (both person-to-person and person-to-machine).

> HCD principle is to avoid specifying the problem as long as possible but instead to iterate upon repeated approximations.

### Discoverability
When we interact with a product, we need to figure out how to work it. This means discovering what it does, how it works, and what operations are possible.

This is composed up of 5 fundamental psychological concepts
1. **Affordances**:  signifies *what* action is possible. It is the relationship between the properties of an objects and the capabilities of the user that determine how the object could be used. For example, a chair affords ("is for") support and therefore affords sitting. If an affordance or anti-affordance cannot be perceived, some means of signaling its presence is required.
2. **Signifiers**: signifies *where* actions should occur. A mark, sound, or perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behaviour to a person. Can be a desire path, a push/pull label, etc.
3. **Constraints**: limits to the possible interactions with an object. For example, the different sized holes in a scissor suggests different numbers of fingers may fit in each hole and not any more.
4. **Mappings**: relationship between the elements of two sets of things. For example, a mapping of light switches to light bulbs or the steering wheel to the direction of the wheels. Groupings and proximity are important principles from Gestalt psychology that can be used to map controls to function: related controls should be grouped together. 
5. **Feedback**: communicating the results of an action or some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request. Has to be a balance, little and poor feedback and too much feedback can also be unhelpful and annoying to users. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.

Conceptual models are explanations (usually highly simplified) of how something works. These can be the desktop metaphor where files, folders, and icons help represent the model of data on the hard drive. We are concerned with mentally held conceptual models -- mental models.

Often times the designer's conceptual model, the system image (how it manifests in reality), and the user's conceptual model are not aligned.
