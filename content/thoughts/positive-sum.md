As opposed to [zero-sum](thoughts/zero-sum.md)

We govern, share, and maintain [public goods] as a society. While imperfect in how they are built or administered, these objects draw us together in dialogue, debate, and common concern

How can we incentivize creation of public goods? Maybe through [quadratic funding](thoughts/quadratic-funding.md).

### Agalmics
Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce goods. We need a new paradigm, and a new field of study. What we need is agalmics.

### Defining 'public'
> The vernacular term "public" is understood to be _something of the people, freely available for use_—such as parks, roads, and common lands.

"**A public can be identified and classified by** **_shared problems_**, the extent to which they are aware of such problems, and the extent to which they do something about it." Similarly, how do we define a [community](thoughts/communities.md)?

Crypto and [web3](toc/web3.md) overcome a lot of the bariers of web1 and web2, namely the inability to satisfy inalienable access to 'public' resources. The internet's so-called "[public spaces](thoughts/digital-commons.md)" are nothing like our cities' public parks. They are merely someone else's private server, where access can be revoked at will.

Public also means creating venues in which people could begin to identify themselves as part of a collective whole.

> To publish a web document or software application is more than making _something_ public: it's an act of making _a_ public (Warner, 2002)

### Defining 'good'
"_Why_ are public parks more desirable than public parking lots? This brings us to an important realization: any definition of public goods presupposes a shared understanding of what is in the public's benefit, and why."

These 'goods' exemplify a set of shared values within the 'public'.

Are there concepts of 'free riders' with public goods? What about [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy-of-the-commons.md)? "It is clearly in the interest of society to promote the creation and consumption of public goods—be they vaccines, public libraries, or open source code"
