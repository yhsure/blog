## The Dunbar number
https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships

There's only so big a social group can get before it decays into smaller ones.

Social Brain Hypothesis -> primates have large brains because they live in socially complex societies: the larger the group, the larger the brain

Applied to humans, Dunbar computed a theoretical maximum of 150 for human social groups.

A range (by a factor of 3)
1. Casual Friends -> 150
2. 'Dinner' Friends -> 50
3. Close Friends -> 15
4. Intimate Friends -> 5

## Social Capacity
Is there an inverse relationship between number of social connections and their depth? If you multiply them, do you get a person's social capacity?

> "The amount of social capital you have is pretty fixed," Dunbar said. "It involves time investment. If you garner connections with more people, you end up distributing your fixed amount of social capital more thinly so the average capital per person is lower."

Because of the increased number of 'social connections' people have today, is [context collapse](posts/images/framing/context-collapse.png) inevitable?

"Yet, when researchers tried to determine whether virtual networks increase our strong ties as well as our weak ones (the ones that Hansen had focussed on), they found that, for now, the essential Dunbar number, a hundred and fifty, has remained constant." Is the Dunbar number a metric for social capacity?

Does social capacity differ across different types of social interactions? e.g. One-to-one vs One-to-many vs Many-to-many (relevant: [digital commons](thoughts/digital-commons.md))
