## The Dunbar number
https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships

There's only so big a social group can get before it decays into smaller ones.

Social Brain Hypothesis -> primates have large brains because they live in socially complex societies: the larger the group, the larger the brain

Applied to humans, Dunbar computed a theoretical maximum of 150 for human social groups.

A range (by a factor of 3)
1. Casual Friends -> 150
2. 'Dinner' Friends -> 50
3. Close Friends -> 15
4. Intimate Friends -> 5

Can we scale trust beyond the Dunbar number? Curious if this is what makes large orgs so sluggish and boring to work at. This applies to scaling orgs and projects too. How do we ensure that [open source](posts/paid-open-source.md) works when more than say 150 people are contributing?

What about in [web3](toc/web3.md)? Structure helps us scale beyond 'natural' community sizes but this seems difficult in a group where the ethos is v much against said centralized structure.

## Social Capacity
Is there an inverse relationship between number of social connections and their depth? If you multiply them, do you get a person's social capacity?

> "The amount of social capital you have is pretty fixed," Dunbar said. "It involves time investment. If you garner connections with more people, you end up distributing your fixed amount of social capital more thinly so the average capital per person is lower."

Because of the increased number of 'social connections' people have today, is [context collapse](posts/images/framing/context-collapse.png) inevitable?

"Yet, when researchers tried to determine whether virtual networks increase our strong ties as well as our weak ones (the ones that Hansen had focussed on), they found that, for now, the essential Dunbar number, a hundred and fifty, has remained constant." Is the Dunbar number a metric for social capacity?

Does social capacity differ across different types of social interactions? e.g. One-to-one vs One-to-many vs Many-to-many (relevant: [digital commons](thoughts/digital-commons.md))

"Modern Loneliness" by Lauv covers a lot of similar topics

## Research
I feel there are dangers of large groups, especially within research. Larger groups lead to more bureaucracy and being ok with the average -- an effect of too many cooks in the kitchen. This leads to ideas that are at the middle of the [distribution](thoughts/data-distributions.md) and tends to discourage more radical, out-of-distribution thinking and research

## Scalability
Why do we feel the need to find the billion-person version of communities? Is this just the [Silicon Valley](thoughts/articles/unrepeatable-miracle-of-silicon-valley.md) question of scale?

Is human intimacy scalable? I think not.

What if the events were universally accessible but instead of serving everyone, serve those who opt-in to participate more? Cultivation > moderation

If we remove misaligned [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) and less people come, then tbh that's better, that eliminates the people you didn't want in the first place
