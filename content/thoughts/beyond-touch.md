> Humanity is using the dynamic medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper.

New representations of thought — written language, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory. Why then, have we been trapped using the desktop/paper metaphor for the last few centuries?

> And what about screens as a whole? Is the future of computation really just sliding fingers around slabs of glass? -- [Jason Yuan](https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289)

Desktop was originally designed in 1973 to suit a very different need in computation—the need to mirror digital content with its physical equivalent (thus, the need for folders an documents)

Premise of a lot of the work behind [DynamicLand](http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf)

## Modes of Human Communication
By upgrading forms of external communication, we can reduce [research debt](thoughts/articles/research-debt.md) and allow us to [collaborate](posts/collaborative-thinking.md) better

### Conversing (person-to-person)
### Presenting (person-to-people)
### Reading/Browsing (media-to-person)
### Writing (person-to-media)
### Thinking (person-to-self)


## Beyond the Desktop Metaphor
**An interface that intentionally exploits the vulnerability of human beings for financial or otherwise selfish gain is inhumane and also despicable.**

**An interface that unintentionally allows the former to take place has  
not been considerate of the full extent of human fragility, and is therefore still inhumane.**

Isn't this just [design justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md)? Considerate design

Reimagining applications and instead using modules and [workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)
