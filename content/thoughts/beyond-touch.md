> Humanity is using the dynamic medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper.

New representations of thought — written language, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory. Why then, have we been trapped using the desktop/paper metaphor for the last few centuries?

Ted Nelson, the guy who coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia, called the continued use of paper simulations as "like tearing the wings off a 747 and driving it as a bus on a highway."

Desktop was originally designed in 1973 to suit a very different need in computation—the need to mirror digital content with its physical equivalent (thus, the need for folders an documents)

Premise of a lot of the work behind [DynamicLand](http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf) and [Jinha Lee](http://www.leejinha.com/home.html)

## Modes of Human Communication
By upgrading forms of external communication, we can reduce [research debt](thoughts/articles/research-debt.md) and allow us to [collaborate](posts/collaborative-thinking.md) better

### Conversing (person-to-person)
Face-to-face, [ephemereal](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md), improvised. As it stands today, most of this happens through spoken word, hand-waving, and static sketches. This makes grasping the same idea as another person extremely difficult (low [bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) communication)

> Words are terrible at representing systems

Can we reduce the time to generate models for ideas down from hours to seconds? Is there any way we can integrate the stage into presentations (much like a play)?

### Presenting (person-to-people)
Blackboards are more flexible than a computer for presentations right now.

> What's the point of a living, dynamic speaker, if the presentation itself is completely static?

Can we create the visuals of a well-polished science YouTube live like a blackboard?

Can we map concept space to physical space and use the stage as an outline of the presentation? Kind of like a book where you can tell how much of it you're finished by the weight of each side, can the audience see what the presenter has already covered?

### Reading/Browsing (media-to-person)
Can we dynamically create content customizable/personalizable for each user? Are there other channels we can use for communicating information outside just text?

Getting this right is critical for effective [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md)

Cool potential features to keep in mind
1. Skimmable at different levels. Is there a 5s version? A 60s version?
2. Transformable. Can the user transform the data into different representations without having to explicitly define these ahead of time?
3. Context-sensitive. Not one size fits all, can we create unique content for every reader/reading depending on their prior understanding and current needs?
4. Interrogable. Can we get clarifications and answers from the text without having the author having to anticipate those questions?

Is it possible to create dynamic spatial media? Virtual museums of information? Are there ways to engage with things other than the hands? Can we storytell as a way to ingest and interact with information?

**The focus is on spatial representation of usable knowledge.**

Can we create a [memory palace](thoughts/memory-palace.md) for people to walk through to recall information and learn new information?

### Writing (person-to-media)
As it stands, writing is just manipulation of symbols. Even for static materials, the symbols just are more literal representations. Coding still, is manipulating indirect [symbolic systems](thoughts/symbolic-systems.md) and [representations](thoughts/representation.md)

Can we show multiple representations of dynamic behaviour? Can we transform between different representations easily?

The goal is to have manipulation of the behaviour and data itself rather than a structure or set of symbols that 'represents' that behaviour/data -> related to the idea of turtles and the LOGO language in [mindstorms](thoughts/books/mindstorms.md)

### Thinking (person-to-self)
Why are almost all representations used in intelletual work (both final product and intermediate scratch work) mostly 2D? Mostly paper or pixels

Can we create dynamic tactile mediums?

> Playfair’s invention of data graphics was transformative because it tapped into capabilities of the human visual system which had gone unused in intellectual work. It may be similarly transformative to tap into the profound capabilities that enable a person to tie a shoelace or make a sandwich, and bring them to bear on more abstract thinking.

## Beyond the Desktop Metaphor
**An interface that intentionally exploits the vulnerability of human beings for financial or otherwise selfish gain is inhumane and also despicable.**

**An interface that unintentionally allows the former to take place has  
not been considerate of the full extent of human fragility, and is therefore still inhumane.**

Isn't this just [design justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md)? Considerate design

Reimagining applications and instead using modules and [workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)

## Interaction Design

Tools address human needs by amplifying human capabilities. Great tools have parts that fit the problem as well as fit the person.

> Go ahead and pick up a book. Open it up to some page. Notice how you _know_ where you are in the book by the distribution of weight in each hand, and the thickness of the page stacks between your fingers. Turn a page, and notice how you would _know_ if you grabbed two pages together, by how they would slip apart when you rub them against each other.

> Take a moment to pick up the objects around you. Use them as you normally would, and sense their tactile response — their texture, pliability, temperature; their distribution of weight; their edges, curves, and ridges; how they _respond_ in your hand as you use them.

Current technology is very much just *Pictures Under Glass*. All interaction are glassy and feel like they have no connection with whatever task you were performing. Almost as if it was just under a pane of glass. List of interactions you can do with *Picture Under Glass*:
1. Slide

When working with our hands, touch does the driving, and vision helps out from the back seat. Moving our limbs and bodies is so well choreographed, its just [telerobotics](thoughts/telerobotics.md) for us. Why should we limit our interactions to a single finger or two?

## The Vision
 _Visions matter_. Visions give people a direction and inspire people to act, and _a group of inspired people is the most powerful force in the world_. If you're a young person setting off to realize a vision, or an old person setting off to fund one, I really want it to be something worthwhile.
