> Humanity is using the dynamic medium merely to emulate and extend static representations from the era of paper.

New representations of thought — written language, numerals, mathematical notation, data graphics — have been responsible for some of the most significant leaps in the progress of civilization, by expanding humanity’s collectively-thinkable territory. Why then, have we been trapped using the desktop/paper metaphor for the last few centuries?

> And what about screens as a whole? Is the future of computation really just sliding fingers around slabs of glass? -- [Jason Yuan](https://uxdesign.cc/introducing-mercury-os-f4de45a04289)

Desktop was originally designed in 1973 to suit a very different need in computation—the need to mirror digital content with its physical equivalent (thus, the need for folders an documents)

Premise of a lot of the work behind [DynamicLand](http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf)

## Modes of Human Communication
By upgrading forms of external communication, we can reduce [research debt](thoughts/articles/research-debt.md) and allow us to [collaborate](posts/collaborative-thinking.md) better

### Conversing (person-to-person)
Face-to-face, realtime, improvised. As it stands today, most of this happens through spoken word, hand-waving, and static sketches. This makes grasping the same idea as another person extremely difficult (low bandwidth communication)

> Words are terrible at representing systems

Can we reduce the time to generate models for ideas down from hours to seconds? Is there any way we can integrate the stage into presentations (much like a play)?

### Presenting (person-to-people)
Blackboards are more flexible than a computer for presentations right now.

> What's the point of a living, dynamic speaker, if the presentation itself is completely static?

Can we create the visuals of a well-polished science YouTube live like a blackboard?

Can we map concept space to physical space and use the stage as an outline of the presentation? Kind of like a book where you can tell how much of it you're finished by the weight of each side, can the audience see what the presenter has already covered?

### Reading/Browsing (media-to-person)
Can we dynamically create content customizable/personalizable for each user? Are there other channels we can use for communicating information outside just text?

Getting this right is critical for effective [knowledge distillation](thoughts/articles/research-debt.md)

Cool potential features to keep in mind
1. Skimmable at different levels. Is there a 5s version? A 60s version?
2. Transformable. Can the user transform the data into different representations without having to explicitly define these ahead of time?
3. Context-sensitive. Not one size fits all, can we create unique content for every reader/reading depending on their prior understanding and current needs?
4. Interrogable. Can we get clarifications and answers from the text without having the author having to anticipate those questions?

Is it possible to create dynamic spatial media? Virtual museums of information? Are there ways to engage with things other than the hands? Can we storytell as a way to ingest and interact with information?

**The focus is on spatial representation of usable knowledge.**

Can we create a [memory palace](thoughts/memory-palace.md) for people to walk through to recall information and learn new information?

### Writing (person-to-media)
### Thinking (person-to-self)


## Beyond the Desktop Metaphor
**An interface that intentionally exploits the vulnerability of human beings for financial or otherwise selfish gain is inhumane and also despicable.**

**An interface that unintentionally allows the former to take place has  
not been considerate of the full extent of human fragility, and is therefore still inhumane.**

Isn't this just [design justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md)? Considerate design

Reimagining applications and instead using modules and [workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)
