[Source: The Evolution of Trust by *Nicky Case*](https://ncase.me/trust/)

For [trust](thoughts/trust.md) to evolve:
1. Repeat interactions must happen. Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future interactions *before* trust can evolve
2. Possible win-win situations. This must be a [positive sum](thoughts/positive%20sum.md) game where *both* players can be better off
3. Low miscommunication. High-tolerance players are possible but if the level of miscommunication is too high (low signal to noise ratio), trust breaks down. Even in low miscommunication situations, it pays to be more forgiving

In the short run, the rules of the game define what the players do. In the long run, players define the rules. Incentive for us to build the environment and rules we want to play in.

Unfortunately, modern day social media means we have less 'close-friends' and thus repeat interactions than ever. With algorithmic news feeds, miscommunication breeds and win-win situations become scarce.

## Applied Game Theory
Game theory feels hard to apply to the real world due to properties like the [Collingridge Dilemma](thoughts/catch%2022.md)

Games, however, are a great test bed for a lot of game theory given how information rich they are. See [game design](thoughts/game%20design.md)
