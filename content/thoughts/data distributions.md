-   Machine Learning and [AI Systems](posts/ai-systems.md) excludes the tail ends of the distributions
	-   this is where minorities live, ends up reproducing existing systems of power (re: [To live in their Utopia](thoughts/To%20Live%20in%20their%20Utopia.md), [Matthew Effect](thoughts/Matthew%20Effect.md))
	-   synthetic/generative/federated models suck at these
	-   most interesting cases ARE outliers (esp. in medical AI)

## Contextual Data
Should data and [information](thoughts/information.md) be contextualized all the time?

1. [context](thoughts/context.md) is important when dealing with historical data. Knowing why certain decisions were made is extremely important
2. We want data to be anonymized to a certain extent. Exposing patient data, for example, is a huge risk.

How do we choose what context to include and what not to include?
