## Theory of Niche Construction
-   many animals intervene in their environment, shaping it in ways that improve the adaptive fit between the agent and its world
-   such animals in part adapt to their niche, in part construct their own
-   the niche construction perspective focuses our attention on the common features of this whole range of cases whereas the extended mind model does not
    -   human capacities, cognitive and non-cognitive alike, turn out to depend on the fact that humans engineer their environment to support their activities
-   extended digestion example
    -   some animals do the hard digestion stuff on-board, powerful jaws, large mouths, lots of time chewing
    -   we cook lmao
    -   also, we selectively breed livestock which improves the food value of domestic stock

## Extended Phenotypes Concept
-   things animals build are part of their phenotype (physical exhibited traits that are determined genetically)
	-   developmentally stable, as heritable and predictable in their ecological effects as other traits
-   e.g. wasp nests, beaver dams, spider webs
- arguably, language and [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) are extended phenotypes
	- language as a phenotypical trait -> [language of thought](thoughts/language%20of%20thought.md) and [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md)
	- like beaver dams, these technologies have evolved by cumulative trail and error but the mechanism of inheritance is cultural rather than genetic
	- inheritance is not strictly vertical, it can be oblique and many-to-one (information flow from many members of the parental generation â€” and from each other)
	- the cognitive competence of generation N+1 individually and collectively depends on cognitive provisioning by generation N
