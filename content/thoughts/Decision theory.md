Choices by one agent in which background conditions are independent of what other agents are doing. We usually represent these decisions with a decision matrix or decision table

e.g. Pascal's Wager

| |God exists|God does not exist|
|--|--|--|
|Believe|Infinite reward|Status quo|
|Don't believe|Infinite loss|Status quo|

Where rows are possible acts, columns are possible states of the world. Each cell is an outcome. They can also be represented using decision trees
