Martin Kleppmann and Heidi Howard: *[Byzantine Eventual Consistency and the Fundamental Limits of Peer-to-Peer Databases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.00472.pdf)*

Kleppmann and Howard prove an equivalent result which states that $\mathcal I$-confluence is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a Byzantine eventual consistency replication algorithm

They define an invariant is a predicate over replica states, i.e. a function $I(S)$ that takes a replica state $S$ and returns either true or false.

A set of transactions is $\mathcal I$-confluent with regard to an invariant $\mathcal I$ if
1. Each replica can execute a subset of the transaction with $\mathcal I$ preserved on that replica
2. Merging the updates from the transactions still preserves $\mathcal I$

A few examples:
- $\mathcal I$-confluent: consider an invariant $\mathcal I(S)$ that is true if every user in $S$ has a non-negative balance
	- If each transaction only increases a user's account balance, then any combination of transactions will still satisfy $\mathcal I$
	- Note that this example is *no longer* $\mathcal I$-confluent if transactions can deduct from a user's account balance
		- Say $A$ has a balance of $50
		- If $T_1$ results in deducting $40 from $A$ and $T_2$ results in deducting $25 from $A$, each transaction is valid on its own
		- But when combined, it violates the invariant $\mathcal I$
		- As a result, we can't model anything like a cryptocurrency using CRDTs
- Not $\mathcal I$-confluent: consider an invariant $\mathcal I(S)$ that is true if there are no duplicate values in $S$ (i.e. ensure that $S$ is a set)
	- If $T_1$ and $T_2$ are both transactions that create data items with the same value in that attribute, each of transaction preserves the constraint
	- However the combination of the two does not

I conjecture that if a data structure is $\mathcal I$-confluent, then it can be expressed in monotonic Datalog. That is, $\mathcal I$-confluence holds if and only if states $S$ can be represented as a join semilattice.

This shows equivalence with the [[thoughts/CALM Theorem|CALM]] conjecture (proof left as an exercise for the reader).
