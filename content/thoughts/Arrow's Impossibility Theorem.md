Assume there is more than one individual, and there are at least three distinct social states. Then there is no SWF that meets the following four conditions:

1. Non-dictatorial: no individual is decisive
2. Ordering: The SWF must produce social preference orderings that satisfy the basic [[thoughts/probability|probability axioms]]
3. [[thoughts/Pareto optimality|Pareto condition]]: If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
4. Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA): If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged

Unstated: Arrow also requires the unrestricted domain assumption (U)

How can we get around this?
1. Sen: give up liberalism (Pareto)
	1. Argues that liberalism + Pareto leads to a contradiction in ordering axioms
	2. Nozick's solution: give up the unrestricted domain assumption (U)
		1. Liberalism excludes certain kinds of states (‘private’ alternatives) from social scrutiny in advance.
