"The fight for liberty is not conducted with natural language in the form of political rhetoric: it is **hashed out in technical protocols**."

A lot about the nomenclature and origin of the name Ethereum.

Interesting quote by Buckminster Fuller (who did a lot of pioneering work on geodesic domes): "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete"

Honestly thought this bit would talk more about why Ethereum is meaningful in the context of [web3](toc/web3.md) and [decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md) :((
