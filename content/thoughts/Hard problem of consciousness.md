How do we bridge objective description and subjective experience (qualia)? Is consciousness explainable in terms of brain processes?

What gives rise to consciousness (rel: [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)), first-person experiences, and a sense of self? Do inanimate and non-human intelligences have personal experiences?

Chalmers
- Certain phenomena are functionally definable -- explanation of them requires only the explanation of the relevant functions and the mechanisms that implement them (e.g. hereditary passing of genes and DNA)
- Consciousness is *not* functionally definable
	- Defining information discrimination, integration, and reporting does not fully explain consciousness
- Explanatory Gap
	- There is no cognitive function such that we can say in advance that explanation of that function will automatically explain subjective experience

### Nagel's Bat Argument (against Physicalism)
1. Physicalism (read: [Materialism](thoughts/Materialism.md)) is the thesis that everything that exists is physical. 
2. Physical facts then, are objective truth ("the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with different perceptual systems")
3. Even if we knew everything about how the bat's sonar system works, we would not know what is is like for the bat to perceive using this system.
	1. 'What it's like': in this case, something is conscious (a bat) if and only if there is something it's like to be that being (only a bat knows what it is like for a bat to be a bat)
	2. One, for example, cannot imagine a chair to know what it is like for a chair to be a chair.
	3. For a state to be conscious is for it to have a subjective character (to seem or feel a certain way to the subject). A conscious experience is a state that is both subjective and qualitative.
4. Therefore, complete knowledge of the physical facts about a bat's  perceptual system would not yield knowledge of certain facts about a  bat’s experiences

Physicalism leaves out the subjective facts, so it’s a mystery how it 
could be true (give that [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and the subjective experience exists).
