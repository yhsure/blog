Maintenance: the gritty upkeep work that keeps the [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) of the world running.

## [Incentivizing](thoughts/incentives.md) Maintenance
*The Maintainers*: the individuals whose work keeps ordinary existence going rather than introducing novel things. Related to [paid open source](posts/paid-open-source.md), how do we incentivize maintenance?

Is maintenance just the battle against the [tragedy of the commons](thoughts/tragedy%20of%20the%20commons.md)? "Fundamentally, digital infrastructure has a free rider problem. Resources are offered for free, and everybody (whether individual developer or large software company) uses them, so nobody is incentivized to contribute back, figuring that somebody else will step in." [Source](https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/23/open-source-sustainability)

Who are all the maintainers behind the thousands of libraries we depend on each day? Is maintenance a form of Ghost Work?

Can we use [web3](thoughts/web3.md) to 'codify' maintenance as a value? Is maintenance inherently centralized (i.e. we need a centralized body to uphold a [public good](thoughts/public%20goods.md))

## [Innovation](thoughts/innovation.md) is overvalued

"What happens _after_ innovation, they argue, is more important. Maintenance and repair, the building of infrastructures, the mundane labour that goes into sustaining functioning and efficient infrastructures, simply has more impact on peopleâ€™s daily lives than the vast majority of technological innovations."

"These shuttles brought high-tech employees from hip, pricey urban homes to their lush suburban campuses, without exposing them to the inconvenience of public transportation or to the vast populations of the poor and homeless who also call Silicon Valley their home." -> similar to some concepts in [From Counterculture to Cyberculture](thoughts/From%20Counterculture%20to%20Cyberculture.md) talking about displacement of people during the 'back to the land'  movement by the New Communalists

**It is crucial to understand that technology is not innovation.** This preoccupation with novelty is unfortunate because it fails to account for technologies in widespread use, and it obscures how many of the things around us are quite old.

The stalest innovation stories focus on well-to-do white guys sitting in garages in a small region of California, but human beings in the Global South live with technologies too. Which ones? Where do they come from? How are they produced, used, repaired?

Third, focusing on [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) or on old, existing things rather than novel ones reminds us of the absolute centrality of the work that goes into keeping the entire world going. We need to acknowledge and attribute where we are today to the shoulders of the giants we stand on.

"Feminist theorists have long argued that obsessions with technological novelty obscures all of the labour, including housework, that women, disproportionately, do to keep life on track."
