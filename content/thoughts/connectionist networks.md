-   architecture
	-   large number of units which are connected to others (connectionism) and the connections have different strengths (weights)
	-   units are arranged in layers
	-   computation happens in parallel
-   like in a classical machine, [representations](/thoughts/representation) are assigned to connectionist networks by the people who build them
-   two types of connectionist representation
	-   localist → each unit is assigned a feature as a whole that represents
	-   distributed → state of the network as a whole represents something
		-   often claimed to be one of the distinctive features of connectionism
		-   connectionist networks is sometimes called parallel distributed processing (PDP)
-   can be trained to learn
-   resemble the structure of the brain much more closely than any classical computer
	-   really good at pattern recognition
