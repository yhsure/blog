In conversation with [[thoughts/Coraline Ada Ehmke|Coraline Ada Ehmke]]

Intros
- Jacky:
- Coraline:

_This interview has been edited for clarity and length._

- start off with who we are, how we got involved with this space
	- coraline: gender transition, experiencing issues of social justice much more intensely, woke something up in her -> codes of conduct being a strong signal
		- now, lack of code of conduct is the strong signal v normalized
		- worry about this normalization is that we forget our history
	- jacky: other side of how i got into open source
		- i spent a lot of time making and maintaining open source projects
		- wasn't until i got contributors that i started getting into the history
		- there's no 101 of being a good maintainer
- how did we get here? understanding the role of engineers and responsibilities that we have
	- story of Chef called out re: no tech for ICE
	- Seth Vargo, a developer at Chef, pulled the code but it got reinstated because it was causing major outages
	- open source traditionalists: you cannot discriminate against people, groups of people or fields of endeavor, even if they are doing bad things!
	- creation of the hippocratic license: lightning rod for broader discussion around the neutrality of tech in general
- on the scale and scope of our work
	- studying cs + phil at school -> leads to thinking a lot about the politics of tech
	- do artifacts have politics?
	- the rising ethical storm -> tracing where this illusion that tech was apolitical comes
		- "moral imperative to prevent our work from being used to harm others"
	- tech as a multiplicative instead of additive tool
		- exacerbate existing discrepancies in distributions of power
		- always seems to be a hidden downside not enough people are acknowledging 
		- nb: this came out of a lot of thinking after reading The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas
	- should developers be responsible for expecting/forecasting how that tech will be used?
	- how do we make these decisions? double-bind of technology: the collingridge dilemma
	- continual decision making
	- in case of conflict, we favor end users, over developers, over browser manufacturers, over spec writers, over pure technological purity
	- some takes that are "regulation bad for innovation"
		- nb: silicon valley move fast and break things attitude, not all progress and innovation is good! but necessary. how do we balance progress w care?
	- on quantization and codification of values
		- re: recent news around constitutional values
- on decentralization + agency of technology [could cut if we run out of space]
	- personal research over the summer: rhizome
	- more data portability, autonomy, and permeability between systems
		- differentiating mobility and permeability
	- offramp existing systems -> onramp to existing systems
	- downloading the source code isn't enough, governance is critically important
		- chrome user-defined styled sheets example
		- frame it in terms of agency
	- participating in governance is hard, reclaiming standards
		- most standards bodies and governance structures for orgs that own standards are incredibly tight and hard for average person to participate in and make meaningful changes/decisions
		- don't know the answer but we definitely need to prioritize it
	- layers of normalization
		- we've normalized codes of conduct
		- let's now let's normalize representative equitable governance of open source technologies
		- let's go a step beyond that, and talk about like standards and enforceable standards
		- beyond that, of course, we have the legal aspects
	- metaphor of securing a server, no single layer is enough, we need all of them
- on how can we bring about these changes? help recognize technology + open source as political and non-neutral
	- what does regulating open source look like?
		- ethical source is not just about the hippocratic license
		- nb: to live in their utopia, systems of feedback and regulation are important
		- it's about building layers of normalization that this is stuff we should care about
			- "Harm reduction is not an event, it's a process. And I think we have to start normalizing those processes. If we have any chance at all of allowing the Internet to like be the incredible force for good that it has the potential to be."
		- not fire and forget either, can perpetuate systemic inequalities if not kept in check
	- interdisciplinary + multidisciplinary technologists
		- moving beyond the individualistic perception of open source as the long hacker in the basement but more so like as curators and crafters of a community around this project that you're building
		- comes down to ingroup vs outgroup: open source technology is simply tooling for people just like us
		- developers build infrastructure and dev tooling because they thats their ingroup, those are the problems they are familiar with
		- by bringing people who've had problems and experiences and other fields, then you start getting useful applications of technology in those areas
		- not through consultation but meaningful empowerment
		- nb: not treating human lives as 'externalities' to systems that spoil the purity of mathematical things
