Creating modular tools for users to [build their own workflows](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/)

> "Each personâ€™s mind works a little differently, and each person remembers and processes information a little differently. I think we all work at our best when we work with tools that fit how our minds work."

When other people build tools for us to use, they either design tools after their own workflows and mental models, or worse, they design it for a mass market of millions of people who all sort-of-but-not-really work and think in similar ways.

Building tools for others usually means the creator builds for their own workflow/mental models: [universal design](thoughts/books/design-justice.md). We create tools that work OK for the majority, but great for no one.

tools you build yourself can grow and change as your workflow changes over time: less of a sense of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital-permanence.md)

Are our tools extensions of who we are? At what point does it just become a part of our mind? Relevant: [the extended mind hypothesis](thoughts/extended-mind.md)
