"The ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the other nor of the self. The ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having been seen by someone, and the equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence of another, to have walked with them, and to have believed in them, and sometimes, just to have accompanied them, for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone" -- David Whyte

Friendship as witnesses to eudaimonic well-being.

> the type of happiness or contentment that is achieved through self-actualization and having meaningful purpose in one's life
