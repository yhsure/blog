[...There was a] positive feedback loop that encouraged me to spend ever-increasing amounts of time on my work. Humans inherit convictions [mimetically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard#Mimetic_desire) from each other — we learn what to value by imitating our peers. Maybe this is why we tend to want to conform to ingroup expectations in [communities](/thoughts/communities) so much?

Dangers of groupthink as these feedback loops loop into themselves and repeat:

Among experimentalists, it’s not hard to find graduate students who can tell you every detail about how a particular machine operates, and almost nothing about why it should be built.

## [Reading](thoughts/reading.md)
Speaking with authors through their written work triggers the same neural circuits that produce imitation of desire. By stocking a bookshelf judiciously, you can express a preference over preferences — “what should I value? What do I want to spend my waking hours thinking about?” — and act on it through careful, honest reading. This engineering is safe: most authors exert their influence slowly, over hundreds of pages, and if the effect turns out to be undesirable, you need only put the book down. It’s cheap and reliable — if you want to emulate someone, start by reading what they read. Most importantly, it’s _powerful_, because authors form a large part of the meta-peer group that determines which communities and games you engage with.
