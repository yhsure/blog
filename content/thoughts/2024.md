- dynamics of being home
	- the farewell: eastern values of doing what they think is best for you rather than how you ask to be treated
		- they assume what is best
			- in the farewell, the family avoids telling nainai about the cancer because they believed her last 3 months better would be happy in blissful ignorance
			- "the burden is better shouldered by the collective rather than the individual, that is the fundamental difference between the east and the west"
				- its ironic because the decision is never made by the individual, its the group assuming what is best for the individual
					- it assumes that the group knows what is better for the individual than the individual themselves
				- in the act of assuming what is best, they create a space where one cannot feel comfortable being anything that is not in their image
	- my parents follow this mentality pretty closely
		- they say they will always support you, but only support the things that align with their view of the world[^1]
		- the hidden parenthetical being "always support you (who we think you should be)"
		- you can try to explain how you look at the world, your beliefs
		- but if, at the root, they believe "their version of you" is what you should strive for, they have no reason to actually listen to you to understand who you are and want to be -- they already know what it should be anyways
			- you can never fully be someone else's idea of who you should be
	- Because what is visible is vulnerable, because what can be seen can be touched and what can be touched can be wounded (Maria Popova on David Whyte's *Consolation II*)
		- what is one to do other than to make the parts of yourself that disagree with their worldview invisible?
	- i do think that things have been net better this year though, its in a large part being more confident in the person i think i am/want to be -- and that shows up in how i talk about the world, even to my parents
		- they are starting to not fight too hard for their worldview to be right -- quiet disapproval but much better than actively trying to squash mine to be theirs
			- they do it out of a place for care and love -- sometimes mismatched but ultimately the intention is there
		- seeing that the life i am carving for myself isnt too bad and things might work out
			- it came from a place where there was a mismatch between the life i wanted to live and how i actually lived it
			- they sensed that unhappiness but wanted to fix it their own way
- on last year broadly -> very good !!!!! maybe the best one yet !!!!!!
	- craft! pottery/guitar
	- you can just do things! playspace -> backbone of my week
	- THE GROUPCHAT
	- had a lot of thoughts about relationships -> the role which platonic vs romantic relationships play in my life
	- nature is good for healing, actually
		- breakup but also sparking human connection -- something about staring at the cosmos and gazing outwards at the world that centers you and brings you together
		- sunsets remain beautiful
	- i had a lay-in-park day completely sober that changed my brain chemistry
	- work has been very good -> learning a stupid amount and it feels like it impacts real people
- what is the life i want to live
	- a deep appreciation of the world and our brief time within it
	- attitues toward life:
		- deep care for people, assume the best of people
		- do things for the sake of doing the thing
		- i want to be good at what i do but not let ego cloud how i perceive others
			- eternal beginners mindset
	- goals
		- looking back at old goals, ive set myself up well :')
		- booth at an art fair
		- keep playspace going
		- carve out morning time for quiet existence without internet
			- read/write
		- spend more time in the outdoors -- its so grounding
			- at least 14 days camping/hiking/out in the woods
		- experiment with style -> dye hair, lean more into fashion, better fitting clothes


[^1]: below
- on worldview disagreement
	- even if i dont consider mine fully formed (or ever will be fully formed), i know i dont want mine to look like theirs
	- its a sad place, full of negativity
		- they see the worst in people, assume bad intentions, lose their temper easily, judge them for surface level actions, cherry-pick things to confirm their observations
		- are hypocritical, dish out advice they wont apply to themselves
		- also suck at conflict resolution -> silent, stonewall, never apologize
			- make themselves always feel like the victim
