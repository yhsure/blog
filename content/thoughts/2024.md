- dynamics of being home
	- the farewell: eastern values of doing what they think is best for you rather than how you ask to be treated
		- they assume what is best
			- in the farewell, the family avoids telling nainai about the cancer because they believed her last 3 months better would be happy in blissful ignorance
			- "the burden is better shouldered by the collective rather than the individual, that is the fundamental difference between the east and the west"
				- its ironic because the decision is never made by the individual, its the group assuming what is best for the individual
					- it assumes that the group knows what is better for the individual than the individual themselves
				- in the act of assuming what is best, they create a space where one cannot feel comfortable being anything that is not in their image
	- my parents follow this mentality pretty closely
		- they say they will always support you, but only support the things that align with their view of the world
		- the hidden parenthetical being "always support you (who we think you should be)"
		- you can try to explain how you look at the world, your beliefs
		- but if, at the root, they believe "their version of you" is right, they will assume that what you know is ever only a subset of what they know about you -- why would they put effort in on their part to understand yours if they think they 'fully understand' you anyways?
	- Because what is visible is vulnerable, because what can be seen can be touched and what can be touched can be wounded (Maria Popova on David Whyte's *Consolation II*)
		- what is one to do other than to make the parts of yourself that disagree with their worldview invisible?
			- (how much of this have i already done??)
	- i do think that things have been net better this year though
	- its in a large part being more confident in the person i think i am/want to be -- and that shows up in how i talk about the world, even to my parents
		- and when my worldview conflicts with their worldview, i dont feel the need to fight them about it anymore
		- they are starting to not fight too hard for their worldview to be right either -- quiet disapproval but much better than actively trying to squash mine to be theirs
			- they do it out of a place for care and love -- sometimes mismatched but ultimately the intention is there
		- seeing that the life i am carving for myself isnt too bad and things might work out
- on last year broadly -> very good !!!!! maybe the best one yet !!!!!!
	- craft! pottery/guitar
	- you can just do things! playspace
	- had a lot of thoughts about relationships -> the role which platonic vs romantic relationships play in my life
	- nature is good for healing, actually
		- breakup but also sparking human connection -- something about staring at the cosmos and gazing outwards at the world that centers you and brings you together
		- sunsets remain beautiful
	- i had a lay-in-park day completely sober that changed my brain chemistry
	- THE GROUPCHAT
	- work has been very good
- what is the life i want to live
	- living a life of tenderness and care
	- i feel like ive gotten very good at masking in social situations because of how i was raised
		- this year im slowly starting to peel that back
