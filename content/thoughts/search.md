The post-WWII 'information explosion' meant that we have a lot of info and not great means of looking through it to find what we want. This is a form of [information retrieval](thoughts/information-retrieval.md).

Inefficient search leads to
1. knowledge gaps
2. errors
3. repeating research
4. times spent searching
5. knowledge silos

Finding stuff is hard because
1. theres a lot of things (large haystack, small needle)
2. semantic meaning and intention is hard to extract/understand
3. search systems are not complete
4. individuals have different requirements for what they are looking for (is it possible to create personalized search engines?)

Good way to prototype search system is to analyze the typical dimensions that users search for things along and build those in. There should be support the five interaction strategies
1. browsing
2. known item searching
3. analytical searching on one or more of the facets
4. empirical searching based on user profiles
5. similarity searching
