The post-WWII 'information explosion' meant that we have a lot of info and not great means of looking through it to find what we want.

Inefficient search leads to
1. knowledge gaps
2. errors
3. repeating research
4. times spent searching
5. knowledge silos

Finding stuff is hard because
1. theres a lot of things (large haystack, small needle)
2. semantic meaning and intention is hard to extract/understand
3. search systems are not complete
4. individuals have different requirements for what they are looking for (is it possible to create personalized search engines?)
