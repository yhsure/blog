## First Meditation → skeptical doubts
-   descartes wants to find a foundation of knowledge that will still stand strong even after doubting the most basic facts about the world
-   everything descartes has accepted has true has come through senses, but senses can deceive
-   First Argument
    1.  Some experiences are deceptive (e.g. visual illusions, mirages)
    2.  Any particular experience I have might be deceptive
    3.  It is possible that _all_ my experiences are deceptive
-   Counterexample to first argument
    -   Some paintings are forgeries
    -   Any particular painting might be a forgery
    -   It is possible that all paintings are forgeries
    -   can't be possible because all paintings if all paintings are forgeries, what are they based off of?
-   Descartes' objection to First Argument
    -   premise 2 doesn't work → any particular experience I have might be deceptive
    -   I am sure of my own thoughts
        -   And yet to have these doubts, he must exist. For an evil demon to mislead him in all these insidious ways, he must exist in order to be misled.
        -   Therefore, thought above all else is inseparable from being. The Meditator concludes that, in the strict sense, he is only a thing that thinks.
## Dream Argument
-   Premises
	1.  i have dreamt at being at my desk
	2.  when i dreamt it, i believed it was true
	3.  when i dreamt it, it was false
	4.  there is no way to tell whether you are dreaming or awake
-   Conclusion → i don't know that I am here at my desk right now
-   as premise 4 is roughly equivalent to the conclusion, this argument is invalid
	-   begs the question → argument which has a premise as a conclusion (circular reasoning)
### The God argument
-   suppose there exists an evil demon, just as powerful as God, but which deceives me about everything he can
-   descartes refutation
	-   it seems possible for there to be such a person
	-   if there were such a person, then everything I believe would be false
	-   I can't tell that there isn't such a person
	-   so, I don't really know anything I thought i knew
