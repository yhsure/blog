from *Epistemic Injustice* by Miranda Fricker

Related to social [power](thoughts/power.md)

Types of epistemic injustice:
1. [Testimonial](thoughts/testimony.md) Injustice: giving a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word for no other reason other than identity prejudice in a way that harms the speaker
2. [Hermeneutical Injustice](thoughts/hermeneutical%20injustice.md): the injustice of having some significant area of one's social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to hermeneutical marginalization

Learning new epistemic resources is difficult for multiple reasons
1. Lack of [trust](thoughts/trust.md) between groups
2. Dominantly situated knower being unwilling to confront destabilizing truths
3. Reluctance or inability of dominant group to recognize the value of the epistemic resources they're being taught

Two main kinds of testimonial injustice
- Receiving more credibility than they otherwise would have (credibility excess)
- Receiving less credibility than they otherwise would have (credibility deficit)
	- E.g. speaker's accent -- indicating certain educational/class/regional background
	- Although can be beneficial in some cases, see the [Jester's Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jester#Jester's_privilege)
- Specifically, this is in the context of the *knower* being wrongly judged in their capacity to be accurate
	- Injustice means it must be harmful but also wrongful
	- Injustice also carries a connotation of [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) to it: it is very hard to believe that one who accidentally misjudges another is committing an injustice against someone (personal belief of Fricker here)

Two modifiers for testimonial injustice
- Persistent: repeated frequently, for example when the injustices occur in the context of their professional life
- Systematic: centered within a system of [power](thoughts/power.md), fundamental to the predominant social, economic, or political practice
