from *Epistemic Injustice* by Miranda Fricker

Related to social [power](thoughts/power.md)

Two main kinds of testimonial injustice
- Receiving more credibility than they otherwise would have (credibility excess)
- Receiving less credibility than they otherwise would have (credibility deficit)
	- E.g. speaker's accent -- indicating certain educational/class/regional background
	- Although can be beneficial in some cases, see the [Jester's Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jester#Jester's_privilege)
- Specifically, this is in the context of the *knower* being wrongly judged in their capacity to be accurate
	- Injustice means it must be harmful but also wrongful
	- Injustice also carries a connotation of [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) to it: it is very hard to believe that one who accidentally misjudges another is committing an injustice against someone (personal belief of Fricker here)

Two modifiers for testimonial injustice
- Persistent: repeated frequently, for example when the injustices occur in the context of their professional life
- Systematic: centered within a system of [power](thoughts/power.md), fundamental to the predominant social, economic, or political practice
