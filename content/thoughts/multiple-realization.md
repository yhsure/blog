Are there multiple ways of realizing intelligence?

-   a bitter lesson
    -   reframing data?
        -   speech data → audio features / mfcc
        -   inadvertently taking away the ability to make new insights based of restrictions
    -   how do we explore more of the solution space
        -   feedforward → linear relationships
        -   sigmoid → non-linear
        -   what other solution spaces are we missing
-   do we necessarily need human intelligence for machine intelligence? most likely not: [multiple-realization](/thoughts/multiple-realization)
