- on site redesigns
	- every year i feel the urge to redesign my website
	- The logo, colors, spacing, tone of voice — it all felt somewhat foreign. How could something so recent and intimate feel unfamiliar?
	- [Paco](https://paco.sh/) gave me an interesting insight into this phenomenon: it shows how much I've changed and learned in the past year.
	- original web was designed to be read-write
		- the little scraps of agency we have left are in the gardens that we can tend to and choose what grows there
		- thats our little personal site
	- "A website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity." (Laurel Schwulst in https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)
	- ive been thinking heavily about what it means to represent yourself online

		- "When I reflect on the lived experience of identity, I think of something that is complex, personal, intersectional, situational, intersubjective."
		- identity as legibility: a process of simplifying, restructuring, and labeling to enable control at scale
		- A desire to make legible is a desire to construct systems that look simple when gazing down from a god’s eye view, when “seeing like a state”.
		- Maps are simplifications. At root is an inability of human values to comprehend the fullness of reality. When seeing with a god’s eye, we become blind to life at street-level.
			- What’s measured gets managed. What’s legible gets controlled.
		- "The internet is adaptive, and will algorithmically reshape its reality around anything that is legible. Google makes clicks legible, so clickbait manifests. Facebook makes reacts legible, so inflammatory content manifests. YouTube makes engagement legible, so creepy videos for toddlers manifest."
			- todays ad-content
			- incredibly susceptible to linkage attacks -> link to differential privacy?
	- counter examples of legibility
		- [[thoughts/Verifiable Credential|VCs]] dont capture the full context of a 'credential' or token
		- didnt graduate because lazy or because of trauma from the death of parents?
	- ecology: study of the relationships between living organisms, and in the widest sense entails the study of the interaction and survival of ideas and program's (Bateson 1979)
	- describes the SSI framework as based on the "neoliberal fallacy of individual choice + control"
	- example from seeing like a state about ecology and monocultures
		- gordon brander + james scott on monocultures
			- The failure follows a [Procrustean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes) pattern:
				1.  Make a map to accomplish systemic goal
				2.  Reality is too complex and refuses to fit into map
				3.  Remake reality in the image of map
				4.  *Systemic collapse*
		- Identity, in what you might call a natural sense, is reciprocally defining and co-constitutive with relationships and information exchange (Wheatley & Kellner-Rogers 1996, 1998). Identities are immanent in contextual relationships, and relationships are immanent in information exchange. A person is a person through other persons (Birhane 2017).
		- In other words, the dots (the nodes, the people) don’t simply define the joins (the edges, the relationships) as Social Networking 101 might have it. We dot the joins in contextual information exchange just as much as we might be said to join the dots. The joins are the pathways for information exchange and transformation, for organising, and the expansion of organisational identity. Joins give the dots their meaning, their contextual relevance, their identity, just as dots give the information exchange direction and potency. 
	- are agency and verb-based identity mutually exclusive
	- noun-based describes the shape of the 6/9
	- verb-based describes the viewing angle
	- not who you are, but what you are authorized to do. So, Keys, not IDs.
