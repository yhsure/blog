> If I identify the book by its content, saying "Check out the book called *Why Information Grows* by CÃ©sar Hidalgo. The ISBN is 0465048994.", you will be able to get any copy of the book from any source and know that you're reading the information I recommended.

> By contrast, if I used location-addressing to identify the book, I would have to point to a location, saying something like "Go to the news stand at Market & 15th in Philadelphia and ask for the thing 16 inches from the south end of the third shelf on the east wall"

Content-addressed storage or abbreviated CAS, is a way to store information so it can be retrieved based on its content, not its location.

Location-addressed: e.g. HTTP, you lookup a content by its location (URI). Whoever controls the location controls the content. This location-addressed approach forces us all to pretend that the data are in only one location (even if multiple people have copies of it!)

Content-addressed: using the content's cryptographic hash to identify it. These links are permanent because the cryptographic hash for a piece of content never changes.
