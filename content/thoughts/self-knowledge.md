Paper #2 for PHIL240A.

> Śiva and God are hanging out, binge-watching a Cosmicflix series called “The Greatest Hits in Philosophy.” It’s the Descartes episode. Descartes says: “To begin with, I acknowledge that it is impossible for God ever to deceive me, for trickery or deception is always indicative of some imperfection” (p. 36) Śiva leans back and smirks. “Now THAT,” he says, “is impressive. I’ve managed to so thoroughly deceive myself that I think I can’t be a deceiver!” God looks sideways at Śiva and responds, “What are you on about? This is one of the greatest moments of insight that one of my creatures has had! Because Descartes clearly and distinctly perceives that I am not a deceiver, he opens himself to all knowledge!” “Oh really?,” Śiva responds. “I thought Descartes already had the key to all knowledge just in the realization ‘I exist.’ He just needs to understand what that means about his own nature!” God pushes pause on the Cosmicflix show and, with a sweep of his arm, transforms their surroundings to a formal debate platform. “OK,” God says, “Time to get to the bottom of what self-knowledge even is. Do you accept the challenge?” “Bring it,” says Śiva, with a grin.

0. Defining self-knowledge
	- agree that on the basis that it is knowledge of one's own mental states
	- well let us define what it means to know one's own mental states
	- god: you scoffed earlier at descartes belief that he could not be deceived because I was good, why is that?
	- siva: well descartes is actually me
		- i am ultimate consciousness
		- i create conventional reality through exclusion (apoha)
		- so i can choose to create imperfection -- i have potential to create any and all manifest worlds
		- this means worlds where i am imperfect and can be deceived
	- god: well so too have i sculped descartes
		- but i am perfect
		- trickery or deception is imperfect so i could never deceive me
	- siva: let me put it this way
		- if descartes was just a mortal being (supposing that you don't subscribe to the fact that descartes is actually a subset of the ultimate reality)
		- do you really think descartes mortal mind could understand your true intentions?
1.  What is the self known through self-knowledge?
	- god + descartes
		- i created descartes
		- for descartes, the self is the thinking being
	- siva: the self is me, descartes and i are one and the same
		- i manifest conventional reality through exclusion
		- Dharmakīrti -> the basic divide between self and world underlies the exclusion process
		- ascertainment of 'jar' is brought about by the free knowing subject and existence of 'non-jar'
			- apoha -> the carving out, because it is similar to a chisel, which is cutting away from all sides
			- still all the same body of consciousness
		- the conventional sense of personal identity is also conceptual (p. 132)
			- The connection, in the case of an entity that is manifested at a certain time, with something that was formerly manifested etc. this connection, top, which occurs thanks to the latent impression, is a mental construct since it is appliked to realities that are manifested as differentiated
1.  What, if anything, about self-knowledge is trustworthy?
	- god + descartes:
		-  cogito sum -> 
	- siva: 
2.  What, if anything, about self-knowledge is deceptive?
	- god + descartes
	- siva
