the amount of depth being slowly unravelled over time is astounding

i think tale for the time being has really got me thinking about time and time differences

not just in absolute offsets in terms of like time zones, but how different people experience life at differing speeds

depending on their context, environment, etc.

and that empathy is really just emotional time dilation and temporarily moving at their pace of live if only for a brief moment
