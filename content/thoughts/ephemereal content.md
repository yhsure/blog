One of the things that keeps face-to-face friendships strong is the [nature of shared experience](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2001-00651-001): you laugh together; you dance together; you gape at the hot-dog eaters on Coney Island together.

## Raider's of the Lost Web

It is really tempting to cover for mistakes by pretending they never happened.
“In Supreme Court opinions, every word matters … When they’re changing the wording of opinions, they’re basically rewriting the law.”

“It’s _gone_ gone. A piece of paper can burn and you can still kind of get something from it. With a hard drive or a URL, when it’s gone, there is just zero recourse.”

The promise of the web is that Alexandria’s [library](thoughts/library.md) might be resurrected for the modern world. But today’s great library is being destroyed even as it is being built. Until you lose something big on the Internet, something truly valuable, this paradox can be difficult to understand.

"Ephemerality is built into the very architecture of the web, which was intended to be a messaging system, not a library." (maybe we need more [friction](thoughts/friction.md)?)

Modern content is sometimes actually assembled on the fly through the likes of Ruby, Django, Next.js, etc. Not actual 'flat'/self-enclosed pages
The data may exist but not the in the format it was originally delivered in

## Tools for Communication

Stream interfaces like Discord and Slack basically create a single global timeline that moves at a certain rate. If you miss a certain conversation, it flows away.

Someone once described Slack as the online version of the open office arrangement -- it puts the pressure of everything being visible all the time to everybody on the individual.

We do "gardening" in our tools for thought but it's not exactly social first. Sure, we can leave messages for each other but this is not communication. It's more like background cueing/prompting.

How can we great mangroves? Garden/forest type ecosystems which have gently flowing multi-branched stream systems.

## Dark Forest

> Imagine a dark forest at night. It’s deathly quiet. Nothing moves. Nothing stirs. This could lead one to assume that the forest is devoid of life. But of course, it’s not. The dark forest is full of life. It’s quiet because night is when the predators come out. To survive, the animals stay silent.

Ephemeral content is the content in the dark forest. Fireflies not lamps.

"These are all spaces where depressurized conversation is possible because of their non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environments."
