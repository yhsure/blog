- Input: take features of examples and corresponding labels as inputs

Generally, the most successful machine learning technique (with the exception of games)

Examples:
- [[thoughts/decision tree|Decision trees]]

## Notation
- $X$ is the input
- $y$ are the class labels
- $n$ is the number of examples (generally idnex is denoted by subscript)
- $d$ is the number of features (generally index is denoted by superscript)
- $\hat y$ are the predictions
