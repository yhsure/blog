## Web2 vs Web3
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/

### Web2
Internet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data.

### Web3
Decentralized apps that run on the blockchain.

Major benefits:
1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)
2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)
3. Turing complete
4. Require no personal data
5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend

Limitations
1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated
2. UX: 
3. Cost: gas fees 

## Cool Applications
### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)
How do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing funding (away from corporations and toward individuals).

Not just providing funding, 4 main value adds
1. Earn -> get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!
2. Learn -> mentorship from industry leaders and peers
3. Connect -> creating a community of builders and support network
4. Fund -> making it easy for developers to support each other
