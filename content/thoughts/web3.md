While crypto protocols operate as open networks, do they truly enact a [public](thoughts/public-goods.md) if solely comprised of private capital?

## Web3 as [public good](thoughts/public-goods.md)
https://otherinter.net/research/positive-sum-worlds/

Crypto protocols are one of the most compelling novel institutional forms, specifically deriving from their "public" qualities
1. unrestricted membership + participation
2. open APIs
3. transparent allocation of resources and pwoer

Yet not perfect
* Ownership of these resources are concentrated in a precious few (whales)
* The 'public' that this infrastructure serves is mostly decentralized finance
Both of these main tokeholders share one common concern: price

### 'Voice' in web3
"The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013)"

"The most consequential members of the crypto-public today are those who hold the most tokens, meaning even small holders are effectively removed from the conversation about what's in their benefit." Same concepts as [design justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md), we need to talk with and consider the marginalized peoples under existing systems of power so we can gain a deeper understanding of the public that we are building for and how to best serve them.

## Obessions with profit
Web3 supposed allows us to 'codify' the set of values that a public goods represents. Yet, in practice in web3, "little space has been made for different values to be discussed or enacted. Which is why, in the absence of ways to enact our shared values, we default to the lowest common denominator: profit."

The United States Dollar does not have a responsibility to profit its holders. A cryptocurrency is a monetary instrument, not a business.

## Web2 vs Web3

### Web2
Internet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data.

Effects include frequent incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the ‘attention economy,’ all of which have fundamentally changed how we relate to one another, and destabilized civic engagement and labor across industries.

### Web3
Decentralized apps that run on the blockchain.

Major benefits:
1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)
2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)
3. Turing complete
4. Require no personal data
5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend

Limitations
1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated
2. UX
3. Cost: gas fees 

## Cool Applications
### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)
How do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing funding (away from corporations and toward individuals).

Not just providing funding, 4 main value adds
1. Earn -> get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!
2. Learn -> mentorship from industry leaders and peers
3. Connect -> creating a community of builders and support network
4. Fund -> making it easy for developers to support each other
