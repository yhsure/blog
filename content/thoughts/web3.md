While crypto protocols operate as open networks, do they truly enact a [public](thoughts/public-goods.md) if solely comprised of private capital?

## Web History
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/
### Web1 [1980s to 2000s]
Internet services were built on open protocols that were controlled by the internet community. Develops could generally rest assured that these protocols wouldn't change much because they were commonly agreed on by the community.

### Web2 [2000s to 2020s]
Internet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data.

General migration from open services to more sophisticated, centralized services

Effects include frequent incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, and the ‘attention economy,’ all of which have fundamentally changed how we relate to one another, and destabilized civic engagement and labor across industries.

### Web3 [2020s to present]
Decentralized apps that run on the blockchain.

Major benefits:
1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)
2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)
3. Turing complete
4. Require no personal data
5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend

Limitations
1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated
2. UX
3. Cost: gas fees 

## Cool Applications
### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)
How do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing [funding](thoughts/funding.md) (away from corporations and toward individuals).

Not just providing funding, 4 main value adds
1. Earn -> get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!
2. Learn -> mentorship from industry leaders and peers
3. Connect -> creating a community of builders and support network
4. Fund -> making it easy for developers to support each other
