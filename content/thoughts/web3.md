## Web2 vs Web3
https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/

### Web2
Internet as we know it today, companies that provide services in exchange for your personal data.

### Web3
Decentralized apps that run on the blockchain.

Major benefits:
1. Anyone on the network can use the service (no one can block/deny you access to the service)
2. Payments are built in (ether or ETH)
3. Turing complete
4. Require no personal data
5. High reliability: runs on decentralized network rather than a single backend

Limitations
1. Scalability/Speed: change to state need to be processed and propagated
2. UX: 
3. Cost: gas fees 

## Why not?
* Too 

the technology feels very "purity"-based (immutability, privacy, etc.) in ways that are not useful or perhaps counterproductive for most applications - the people who care about the pure/extreme qualities are usually doing illegal things, dealing with huge quantities of $, or at high risk like dissidents

 I keep thinking my major issue with crypto is that its economics are imported from the off-chain world and have to interact with it--people who come in rich and benefit from real-world inequalities can then perpetuate that in crypto while those who work to build communities and workers' equity/equality don't necessarily have so much to gain and are less likely to be rewarded with investment...


## Cool Applications
### [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/)
How do we incentivize [open source software](posts/paid-open-source.md)? Gitcoin approaches this through decentralizing funding (away from corporations and toward individuals).

Not just providing funding, 4 main value adds
1. Earn -> get paid to do maintenance work and upkeep of public goods!
2. Learn -> mentorship from industry leaders and peers
3. Connect -> creating a community of builders and support network
4. Fund -> making it easy for developers to support each other
