> How should we make decisions about the environment, or any other issue that combines large negative utilities (e.g., potential catastrophe) with probabilities that are either small or uncertain? The theory of decisions under ignorance offers possible answers (e.g., Maximin or Minimax Regret). A second answer is to use the theory of decisions under risk: we should postpone any decision until we have more information about the probabilities and utilities. A third option is the [[thoughts/Precautionary Principle]]: in cases where there is a potential for catastrophic harm, we should take appropriate precautionary measures to prevent such harm without waiting for more knowledge.

a) Using one of the texts below (or another source of your choosing), explain how the author interprets the precautionary principle.

b) Is the precautionary principle incoherent or irrational? Each of the readings below examines this question. Consider one or at most two of these readings. Explain and evaluate the arguments both for and against the claim that the precautionary principle is incoherent (it may both recommend and prohibit the same action) or irrational (its recommendations are extreme: it proposes disaster-preventing measures that are unjustifiably expensive or harmful).
