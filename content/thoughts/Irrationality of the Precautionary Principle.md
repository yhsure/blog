> How should we make decisions about the environment, or any other issue that combines large negative utilities (e.g., potential catastrophe) with probabilities that are either small or uncertain? The theory of decisions under ignorance offers possible answers (e.g., Maximin or Minimax Regret). A second answer is to use the theory of decisions under risk: we should postpone any decision until we have more information about the probabilities and utilities. A third option is the [[thoughts/Precautionary Principle]]: in cases where there is a potential for catastrophic harm, we should take appropriate precautionary measures to prevent such harm without waiting for more knowledge.

a) Using one of the texts below (or another source of your choosing), explain how the author interprets the precautionary principle.

b) Is the precautionary principle incoherent or irrational? Each of the readings below examines this question. Consider one or at most two of these readings. Explain and evaluate the arguments both for and against the claim that the precautionary principle is incoherent (it may both recommend and prohibit the same action) or irrational (its recommendations are extreme: it proposes disaster-preventing measures that are unjustifiably expensive or harmful).

The Precautionary Principle has had many different interpretations across game theory, 

In its most commonly cited form, the Precautionary Principle is the "idea that action should be taken to prevent something bad from happening, even if there is not definitive proof that it will happen". It is often applied in the context of environmental decision-making, where the potential consequences of certain actions or policies on the environment and human health can be difficult to predict with certainty. In such cases, the Precautionary Principle suggests that we should take appropriate measures to prevent potential harm, even if the likelihood or severity of that harm is uncertain.

The Precautionary Principle is not without its limitations, however, and Manson makes it clear . It is not always clear what constitutes appropriate precautionary measures, and different stakeholders may have different ideas about what is appropriate in a given situation. Additionally, the Precautionary Principle may lead to decisions that are overly conservative, resulting in unnecessary costs or trade-offs. In some cases, it may be more appropriate to use other decision-making frameworks, such as the theories of decision-making under ignorance or risk, to make decisions about potential catastrophic harms.

- PP has many different articulations. They often all get conflated for each other
- This is that strong versions of the PP, if applied consistently, lead to paradoxical outcomes.
Manson's argument dismantles the strong version of PP but not the weaker one
- perhaps treat cumulative risks differently from occasional risks
- Sometimes the Precautionary Principle is deployed to put the burden-of-proof on those who propose a change from the status quo: demonstrate that you have thought through the possible consequences and that you are prepared to meet them before you go through with your plan.
	- who does it place burden of proof on?
	- What standard justifies holding action to a higher burden of proof than inaction?
		- The **Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics** says that when you interact with a problem in any way, you can be blamed for it.


- Versions of the precautionary principle are many, both in terms of wording and in terms of surface syntactic structure (Neil A. Manson, p. 263)
	- Formulation in Principle 15 of the 1992 Rio Declaration of the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development: In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation
	- i.e. if we don't know for sure whether something can prevent environmental degradation, we should still try it
	- For a given activity that may have a given effect on the environment, the precautionary principle is supposed to indicate a remedy
		- E-activities include things such as commercial fishing, burning fossil fuels, developing land, releasing genetically modified organisms, using nuclear power, generating electrical fields, and disposing of toxic chemicals
		- E-effects are outcomes such as the depletion of fish stocks, global warming, species extinction, a loss of biodiversity, nuclear contamination, cancer, and birth defects
		- E-remedies include measures such as an outright ban on the e-activity, a moratorium on it, strict regulation of it, and further research into it
	- A review of the many statements of the precautionary principle indicates there is a general, three-part structure shared by every version.
		- Damage condition; it specifies the characteristics of an e-effect in virtue of which precautionary measures should be considered
		- Knowledge condition; it specifies the status of knowledge regarding the causal connections between the e-activity and the e-effect
		- Remedy condition: it specifies the e-remedy that decision makers should take in response to the e-activity
	- If the e-activity meets the damage condition and if the link between the e-activity and the e-effect meets the knowledge condition, then decision makers ought to enact the specified e-remedy
	- Questions of reversability: Consider a decision maker confronted with the proposal to dam a river. He or she knows that the dam will result in the death of all of the native trout, but also knows that in the future the dam can be removed and the river re-stocked with non-native trout. Is the e-effect confronting him or her irreversible or not? Those who promote versions of the precautionary principle which appeal to irreversibility should provide a definition of irreversibility that enables such questions to be answered.
	-  But what about irreversibility? If an e-effect is irreversible, does that mean it is, in that respect, a bad thing?
- Arguments based on the catastrophe principle are self-defeating
	- If the impression that the precautionary principle is absolute and unconditional is a mistaken one, its advocates would do well to ask themselves what they are doing to generate that impression
- Catastrophe principle
	- One in which the damage condition is that the e-effect is catastrophic and the knowledge condition is that there is a possibility the e-activity leads to the e-effect.
- People in the real world need to act. They want to know what to do, and they must decide now, before it is too late.
- Pascal's Wager
	- Outline + many-gods objection
	- The "many-gods" objection brings to light the following general point regarding the catastrophe principle: even if an e-effect is catastrophic, that fact cannot rationally compel us to impose an e-remedy unless we also know that the e-remedy itself does not lead to catastrophic results
	- Attempts to remedy this fail pretty badly
	- Upshot: As recent history has shown, well-intentioned safety measures can lead to damaging consequences
		- callback to Seeing like a state
- Formulation of PP must follow these 5 specifictions
	1. The component concepts should be clearly defined
	2. The damage conditions identified should be such that a state possessing one of those features does, indeed, have great disvalue-if not always, then most of the time
	3. Since the burden of proof is determined by the knowledge condition, the knowledge condition must be chosen in light of the particular political and legal systems in which the formulation will be applied.
	4. Included within the e-remedy should be some sort of pledge to continue research, for otherwise the formulation might have the effect of rewarding ignorance.
		- perhaps a Popperian approach to e-remedy, continuously revise/redeploy
	5. The formulation chosen must not be self-defeating-that is, it must not be such that the imposition of the e-remedy itself gets ruled out on grounds that it is in violation of the formulation

A Core Precautionary Principle by STEPHEN M. GARDINER
- In particular, the recent literature tends to distinguish between weak and strong versions of the principle, and to regard the first as vacuous and the second as extreme, myopic and irrational.
- The dual trigger characterization suggests that the precautionary principle has three important components:
	- Threat of harm
	- Uncertainty of impact and causality
	- Precautionary response
- Debate around Precautionary Principle has been so heavy is because these three greatly change the plausibility of PP
- Ultraconservative Precautionary Principle (UCPP): Ban any activity that one has any reason whatsoever to suspect might pose any harm whatsoever.
- The Ultraminimal Precautionary Principle (UMPP): We accept the need to act in a precautionary manner in exactly one case: we should cross our fingers (or just worry) in the situation where there is a probability of 99.9% that the world is going to end immediately due to this experiment.
- We want to exclude both of the above. First, if no one believes that we should never take any kind of precautionary measures, and no one asserts that we should always exercise extreme precaution either, such positions are simply straw men and therefore an unnecessary distraction.
- Second, in the search for an intermediate form, the real action involves identifying the relevant circumstances under which the precautionary principle is operative, by making clear what kinds of threats and uncertainty trigger the precautionary principle and what kinds of precaution are thereby triggered.
- Rawlsian Maximin. Rawls argues that maximin is a plausible principle under three general circumstances. 
	- Decision-makers either lack, or have reason to sharply discount, information about the probabilities of the possible outcomes of their actions
	- Decision-makers care relatively little for potential gains that might be made above the minimum that can be guaranteed by the maximin approach
	- Decision-makers face unacceptable alternatives
- Manson’s central concern is that the epistemic standards for the application of the catastrophe principle are extremely low. Mere possibility is enough. Second, since mere possibilities are easy to construct, Manson thinks that the catastrophe principle can easily be made to license the avoidance of not only any action, but also its contradictory
- Of these situations, the RCPP properly applies only in cases of decision under uncertainty. The first Rawlsian condition explicitly rules out circumstances of risk, since it stipulates that probability information is known. More importantly, strict ignorance of some possibilities is also ruled out, because the RCPP assumes that in order even to apply a maximin principle one must be able to compare the possible outcomes.
- Manson objection again: proponent of the precautionary principle is committed to counting any imaginable outcome as possible
- How do we distinguish reasonable outcomes (ones we should consider) to contrast with those outcomes which are merely imaginable (ones we should not)
- Add another circumstance: the range of outcomes considered are in some appropriate sense "realistic," so that, for example, only credible threats are considered.
	- Hence, they may simply presuppose a background account of the outcome set to be considered, which presupposes a notion of realistic threat. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implicitly dealt with by the conjunction of the "care little for gains," and "disaster" conditions.
	- This is unsatisfactory
