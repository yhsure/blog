> The future is manifested

Shared fiction as a statement about the future instead of a statement of today. They're both fictions in that they can't be (dis)proved and thus can have the same functions in a group of people (bring together, motivate to action, share values/language, etc.)

Reminds me of why being ambitious is important and why we should have nondystopian scifi -- there's value in reclaiming an optimistic and hopeful future (very Reboot vibes). I love the concept of skyhooks: dream about what you can build as if the sky had hooks you could hang your creations from (a metaphor for unlimited resources) and most of the time, you can still create that with scarce resources.

Steve Grand in *Creation: Life and How to Make It*
> If an architect believes for a moment that there are hooks in the sky to hang his creations from, he may be able to conceive of structures that he would otherwise not dare to think about. Once the design starts to take shape, he may then begin to see ways in which the essence of it can still be achieved without the need for sky-hooks at all. Maybe this will work for us, too.

> To see things as they really are, you must imagine them for what they might be. -- Ruha Benjamin

In part why I really like reading things like The Book of Predictions where people from the 1970s just make predictions about the far future and see how correct they were. A lot of completely wrong predictions but some are eerily accurate (e.g. distributed and accessible compute). Now, you look at todays predictions of the future and it looks the same as the dreams we had 50 years ago about flying cars and space-faring societies. 

Where are our futures with no famine and disease? With a clean and healthy planet? Of universal free access to information? Where did the ambition go?

## The Big Here and Long Now
> "Humans are capable of a unique trick: creating realities by first imagining them, by experiencing them in their minds. When Martin Luther King said "I have a dream", he was inviting others to dream it with him. Once a dream becomes shared in that way, current reality gets measured against it and then modified towards it."

The act of imagining something makes it real. Art as processes or the seeds for processes - things that exist and change in time, things that are never finished.
