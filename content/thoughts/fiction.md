> The future is manifested

Shared fiction as a statement about the future instead of a statement of today. They're both fictions in that they can't be (dis)proved and thus can have the same functions in a group of people (bring together, motivate to action, share values/language, etc.)

Reminds me of why being ambitious is important and why we should have nondystopian scifi -- there's value in reclaiming an optimistic and hopeful future (very Reboot vibes). I love the concept of skyhooks: dream about what you can build as if the sky had hooks you could hang your creations from (a metaphor for unlimited resources) and most of the time, you can still create that with scarce resources.

In part why I really like reading things like The Book of Predictions where people from the 1970s just make predictions about the far future and see how correct they were. A lot of completely wrong predictions but some are eerily accurate (e.g. distributed and accessible compute). Now, you look at todays predictions of the future and it looks the same as the dreams we had 50 years ago about flying cars and space-faring societies. 

Where are our futures with no famine and disease? With a clean and healthy planet? Of universal free access to information? Where did the ambition go?
