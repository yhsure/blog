## A Traditional Account
- bhāvanā = “bringing into being” certain types of mental states, qualities, and traits through repeated practice
- śamatha(calm, tranquility): a state of sustained and stable attention, concentration.
- Classical [mindfulness](thoughts/mindfulness.md), attempting to achieve states of
	- Remembering/recollecting (smṛti): holds an object in mind so as to prevent the mind from drifting away from it.
	- Clear comprehension (samprajanya): clear knowing through alert awareness of experience.
- Nondual mindfulness
	- present-centred open awareness with "mere nondistraction"

## A Cognitive Science Approach
- Focused Attention
	- Directing attention towards an object (e.g. breathing)
	- Detecting mind wandering/distractions
	- Disengagement of attention from distractors
	- Leads to effortless sustained attention and ability to monitor attention and notice mind-wandering
	- [Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15936259/) showing that focussed attention led to extreme increases in perceptual dominance both during and after meditation
- Open Awareness
	- No explicit focus on objects
	- Nonreactive
	- Leads to acute awareness of phenomenal qualities of experience without ‘grasping’ (approach/avoidance).
