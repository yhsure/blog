-   how could we try to improve the processes/tools that we use to protect our biodiversity and respond quickly enough to have a chance
-   4 focus areas
    -   agriculture
    -   water
    -   biodiversity
    -   climate change
-   oceanmind → uses AI to track fishing boats and identify suspicious behaviour (illegal fishing for example)
-   wildbook → citizen science fingerprinting for animals using AI (aggregating social feeds from the public)
    -   e.g. post an image of a new animal and if its new, alert scientists etc.
    -   youtube input
        -   detect language and translate
        -   text analysis and prediction
        -   extract video keyframes
        -   object detection and prediction
        -   extract text from video
        -   determine where and why
    -   facebook page for animals
-   planetary computer
    -   mostly data
    -   compute environment!
    -   application where
        -   classification → what is where and how much is there?
            -   e.g. land user/cover, biodiversity surveys
        -   forecasting → what might be where in the future?
            -   e.g. flood risk mapping, deforestation prediction
        -   planning → how might we best accomplish x?
            -   e.g. conservation spatial planning, prioritizing carbon offset projects
        -   diagnostics → what was the actual impact of human intervention (both intentional and unintentional) on ecosystems and climate?
            -   e.g. carbon offset credit retrospective analysis, GHG emissions monitoring
-   green ai
    -   more efficient/less compute
    -   green data centers
