What does it mean to be conscious? Is consciousness emergent from matter? Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?

[Materialism](thoughts/mind%20body%20problem.md) is the view that the universe is made up of particles and behaviour (esp. consciousness) arises out of it. There is nothing special distinguishing mind from matter.

> To be conscious is to have subjective human experience, to have *[qualia](thoughts/qualia.md)*.

No one person experiences red, the smell of garlic, or the warmth of the sun in the same way.

Yet, it feels like consciousness is in intrinsic property. We don't know if someone or something is consciousness unless we ask them. However, the inability to _report_ a subjective experience is not the same thing as _not having one_. ([locked-in syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome)). For all we know, that rock could be conscious.

As an extended thought experiment, how similar do minds have to be to human ones to be considered conscious?
