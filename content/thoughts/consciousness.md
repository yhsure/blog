What does it mean to be conscious? Is consciousness emergent from matter? Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?

"Consciousness is always consciousness of something, and when the object is subtracted, nothing remains to be characterized" (cannot be of independent origin, [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md))

Phenomenal consciousness (felt consciousness) vs Access consciousness

Gross consciousness (obvious waking state) vs Subtle consciousness (sleep/deep sleep). In more Indian philosophy, consciousness is that which is luminous (revealing) and has capacity for cognition.

## Reflexivity vs Reflectivity
Self-illumination/reflexivity  
- Every conscious experience is directly revealed to itself.  
- "In seeing blue, you experience seeing"
- Problems: Reflexivity as a concept is weird though
	- "A knife cannot cut itself, an acrobat can’t stand on their own shoulders."
	- "How can one and the same awareness be both of an object/content and of itself?"

Other-illumination/reflectivity  
- For a state to be a conscious state is for it to be the object of a higher-order mental state (an inner perception or inner thought).
- "I see blue, I'm aware that I see blue"
- Problems: how could two states that are nonconscious in themselves come together and make one of them conscious?
	- Curious how this applies to [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)
	- By having a higher layer that enables the reference of a lower layer, this is essentially a two-way recursive relation that opens the door to much more composable and perhaps complex behaviour

Nagarjana's Argument
- Infinite regress, you cannot use a fact to establish itself
- Summarized in terms of reflectivity
	- argues against reflexivity
Opponents Argument
- Can use recursive definition

## Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)
- Experimentally, content-specific NCCs are identified by comparing conditions where specific conscious contents are present versus absent.
	- Similar to probing for network activation in neural networks / [AI systems](posts/ai-systems.md)
- The full NCC is the union of all content-specific NCCs.
- Even for ambiguous figures (those weird visual illusions that have differing things depending on how you perceive it), there is a rivalry for a dominant interpretation
	- When faced with ambiguous visual information, you don’t normally experience a combination of the different interpretations. Rather, you only see one at a time, often switching back and forth between the two.
	- Binocular rivalry

Theories of consciousness
- Cognitive Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to cognitive processing (thinking, reasoning, evaluating, memory, etc.)
	- Global workspace theory: consciousness arises from highly coordinated, widespread activity in the brain
		- When signals are broadcast to the global workspace, we become conscious of the sensation
		- When they remain localized, they are not perceived conscoiusly
- Sensory Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to sensory processing
	- Block argues that recurrent processing in sensory areas is the NCC for phenomenally conscious perception
- First-order theories: consciousness is a product of the cognitive processing of sensory information
- Higher-order theories: consciousness involves something done to build on that cognitive representation of the sensory experience

Does phenomenal awareness overflow access?
- (when reading,) we are conscious only of the letters attended to and the impression that there are other items displayed whose identity we don’t know. Once the cue is presented, we gain access to the unconscious information before it decays and can recall the letters.
- Great example of why foveated rendering works so well

## Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IIT)
First-order sensory theory of consciousness.

> Consciousness *is* integrated information

The amount of information $\phi$ that the entire complex system has beyond the information available from the sum of its parts (i.e. Information that can’t be localized in the system's individual parts.)

Has many holes in its axioms but again presented here just to learn:
1. Intrinsic Existence: consciousness must exist from its own intrinsic perspective, independent of external observers
2. Composition: consciousness is structured and composed of multiple phenomenological distinctions (elementary or higher order)
3. Information: consciousness is specific. Each experience is particular and uniquely distinct
4. Integration: consciousness is unified. Each experience is irreducible and cannot be subdivided into non-interdependent disjoint subsets of phenomenal distinctions
5. Exclusion: consciousness is definite -- it either has or does not have certain phenomenal distinctions
