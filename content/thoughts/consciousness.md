What does it mean to be conscious? Is consciousness emergent from matter? Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?

Phenomenal consciousness (felt consciousness) vs Access consciousness

Gross consciousness (obvious waking state) vs Subtle consciousness (sleep/deep sleep). In more Indian philosophy, consciousness is that which is luminous (revealing) and has capacity for cognition.

## Reflexivity vs Reflectivity
Self-illumination/reflexivity  
- Every conscious experience is directly revealed to itself.  
- "In seeing blue, you experience seeing"
- Problems: Reflexivity as a concept is weird though
	- "A knife cannot cut itself, an acrobat can’t stand on their own shoulders."
	- "How can one and the same awareness be both of an object/content and of itself?"

Other-illumination/reflectivity  
- For a state to be a conscious state is for it to be the object of a higher-order mental state (an inner perception or inner thought).
- "I see blue, I'm aware that I see blue"
- Problems: how could two states that are nonconscious in themselves come together and make one of them conscious?
	- Curious how this applies to [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)
	- By having a higher layer that enables the reference of a lower layer, this is essentially a two-way recursive relation that opens the door to much more composable and perhaps complex behaviour

Nagarjana's Argument
- Infinite regress, you cannot use a fact to establish itself
- Summarized in terms of reflectivity
	- argues against reflexivity
	- 
Opponents Argument
- Can use recursive definition

## Hard problem of consciousness
Related: [mind body problem](thoughts/mind%20body%20problem.md), [Materialism](thoughts/Materialism.md)

How do we bridge objective description and subjective experience (qualia)? Is consciousness explainable in terms of brain processes?

What gives rise to consciousness (rel: [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)), first-person experiences, and a sense of self? Do inanimate and non-human intelligences have personal experiences?

Chalmers
- Certain phenomena are functionally definable -- explanation of them requires only the explanation of the relevant functions and the mechanisms that implement them (e.g. hereditary passing of genes and DNA)
- Consciousness is *not* functionally definable
	- Defining information discrimination, integration, and reporting does not fully explain consciousness
- Explanatory Gap
	- There is no cognitive function such that we can say in advance that explanation of that function will automatically explain subjective experience

### Nagel's Bat Argument (against Physicalism)
1. Physicalism (read: [Materialism](thoughts/Materialism.md)) is the thesis that everything that exists is physical. 
2. Physical facts then, are objective truth ("the kind that can be observed and understood from many points of view and by individuals with different perceptual systems")
3. Even if we knew everything about how the bat's sonar system works, we would not know what is is like for the bat to perceive using this system.
	1. 'What it's like': in this case, something is conscious (a bat) if and only if there is something it's like to be that being (only a bat knows what it is like for a bat to be a bat)
	2. One, for example, cannot imagine a chair to know what it is like for a chair to be a chair.
	3. For a state to be conscious is for it to have a subjective character (to seem or feel a certain way to the subject). A conscious experience is a state that is both subjective and qualitative.
4. Therefore, complete knowledge of the physical facts about a bat's  perceptual system would not yield knowledge of certain facts about a  bat’s experiences

Physicalism leaves out the subjective facts, so it’s a mystery how it 
could be true (give that [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and the subjective experience exists).

### Frank Jackson's Knowledge Argument
- Mary is confined to a black-and-white room, is educated through black-and-white books and through lectures relayed on black-and-white TV. Through this, she learns everything there is to know about the physical nature of the world, including all there is to know about the causal and relational facts consequent upon all this, including of course functional roles.
- If physicalism is true, she knows all there is to know.
- Yet, if Mary is let out of her black-and-white room or given a colour TV, she will learn what it is like to see something red.

The implication here is that Mary cannot learn what it is like to subjectively experience red from reading physical facts (similar argument re: [semantics](thoughts/semantics.md) in [Chinese room argument](thoughts/Chinese%20room%20argument.md)).

### Dennett's Refutation of the Knowledge Argument

> “And so, one day, Mary’s captors decided it was time for her to see colours. As a trick, they prepared a bright blue banana to present as her first colour experience ever. Mary took one look at it and said ‘Hey! You tried to trick me! Bananas are yellow but this one is blue!’ Her captors were dumbfounded. How did she do it? ‘Simple,’ she replied. ‘You have to remember that I know everything—absolutely everything— that could ever be known about the physical causes and effects of colour vision.
