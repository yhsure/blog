What does it mean to be conscious? Is consciousness emergent from matter? Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?

"Consciousness is always consciousness of something, and when the object is subtracted, nothing remains to be characterized" (cannot be of independent origin, [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md))

Types of consciousness:
- Phenomenal consciousness (felt consciousness) vs Access consciousness
- Gross consciousness (obvious waking state) vs Subtle consciousness (sleep/deep sleep). In more Indian philosophy, consciousness is that which is luminous (revealing) and has capacity for cognition.

Theories of consciousness
- Cognitive Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to cognitive processing (thinking, reasoning, evaluating, memory, etc.)
	- Global workspace theory: consciousness arises from highly coordinated, widespread activity in the brain
		- When signals are broadcast to the global workspace, we become conscious of the sensation
		- When they remain localized, they are not perceived conscoiusly
- Sensory Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to sensory processing
	- Block argues that recurrent processing in sensory areas is the NCC for phenomenally conscious perception
	- e.g. [Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)](thoughts/Neural%20Correlates%20of%20Consciousness%20(NCC).md)
- First-order theories: consciousness is a product of the cognitive processing of sensory information
	- e.g. [Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IIT)](thoughts/Integrated%20Information%20Theory%20of%20Consciousness%20(IIT).md)
- Higher-order theories: consciousness involves something done to build on that cognitive representation of the sensory experience
	- e.g. [Stream of Consciousness](thoughts/Stream%20of%20Consciousness.md)
