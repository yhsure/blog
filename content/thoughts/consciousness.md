What does it mean to be conscious? Is consciousness emergent from matter? Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?

Phenomenal consciousness (felt consciousness) vs Access consciousness

Gross consciousness (obvious waking state) vs Subtle consciousness (sleep/deep sleep). In more Indian philosophy, consciousness is that which is luminous (revealing) and has capacity for cognition.

## Reflexivity vs Reflectivity
Self-illumination/reflexivity  
- Every conscious experience is directly revealed to itself.  
- "In seeing blue, you experience seeing"
- Problems: Reflexivity as a concept is weird though
	- "A knife cannot cut itself, an acrobat canâ€™t stand on their own shoulders."
	- "How can one and the same awareness be both of an object/content and of itself?"

Other-illumination/reflectivity  
- For a state to be a conscious state is for it to be the object of a higher-order  
 mental state (an inner perception or inner thought).
- "I see blue, I'm aware that I see blue"
- Problems: how could two states that are nonconscious in themselves come together and make one of them conscious?
	- Curious how this applies to [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)
	- By having a higher layer that enables the reference of a lower layer, this is essentially a two-way recursive relation that opens the door to much more composable and perhaps complex behaviour

## Materialism
[Materialism](thoughts/mind%20body%20problem.md) is the view that the universe is made up of particles and behaviour (esp. consciousness) arises out of it. There is nothing special distinguishing mind from matter.

> To be conscious is to have subjective human experience, to have *[qualia](thoughts/qualia.md)*.

No one person experiences red, the smell of garlic, or the warmth of the sun in the same way.

Yet, it feels like consciousness is in intrinsic property. We don't know if someone or something is consciousness unless we ask them. However, the inability to _report_ a subjective experience is not the same thing as _not having one_. ([locked-in syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome)). For all we know, that rock could be conscious.

As an extended thought experiment, how similar do minds have to be to human ones to be considered conscious?
