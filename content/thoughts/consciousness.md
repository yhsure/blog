What does it mean to be conscious? Is consciousness emergent from matter? Or is it something else entirely (the ether or the soul)?

"Consciousness is always consciousness of something, and when the object is subtracted, nothing remains to be characterized" (cannot be of independent origin, [emptiness](thoughts/emptiness.md))

Types of consciousness:
- Phenomenal consciousness (felt consciousness) vs Access consciousness
- Gross consciousness (obvious waking state) vs Subtle consciousness (sleep/deep sleep). In more Indian philosophy, consciousness is that which is luminous (revealing) and has capacity for cognition.

Theories of consciousness
- Cognitive Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to cognitive processing (thinking, reasoning, evaluating, memory, etc.)
	- Global workspace theory: consciousness arises from highly coordinated, widespread activity in the brain
		- When signals are broadcast to the global workspace, we become conscious of the sensation
		- When they remain localized, they are not perceived conscoiusly
- Sensory Theories: consciousness is based in areas that are devoted to sensory processing
	- Block argues that recurrent processing in sensory areas is the NCC for phenomenally conscious perception
	- e.g. [Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)](thoughts/Neural%20Correlates%20of%20Consciousness%20(NCC).md)
- First-order theories: consciousness is a product of the cognitive processing of sensory information
	- e.g. [Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IIT)](thoughts/Integrated%20Information%20Theory%20of%20Consciousness%20(IIT).md)
- Higher-order theories: consciousness involves something done to build on that cognitive representation of the sensory experience
	- e.g. [Stream of Consciousness](thoughts/Stream%20of%20Consciousness.md)

## Minimal Phenomenal Experience
Simplest form in which a state can be phenomenally conscious

Dreamless sleep experience is a candidate for this

Background [phenomenologies](thoughts/phenomenology.md) claim these experiences combine
- minimal dimensionality (of awareness)
- maximal prototypicality (overlap with other states/modes of awareness)

If we find a minimal form of phenomenal experience in all forms of phenomenal content and underlies all conscious experience, then this model would amount to solving the problem of consciousness as such

Problems for interpreting reports of pure awareness in meditative experience
1. Embodied theory contamination: background theoretical assumptions strongly condition personal beliefs and thus processing and reporting
2. Conceptual consistency: how does one interpret words like "perceive", "luminous", "radiant" in reports of experiences that are supposed to be "contentless"
3. Performative self-contradiction: "I experienced a selfless state" is a self-contradictory 

### Metzinger's 6D concept of MPE
1. PC1 - Wakefulness: phenomenal quality of tonic alertness (intrinsic arousal and focus of attention)
2. PC2 - Low Complexity: absence of high-level symbolic mental content, perceptual, sensorimotor, emotional content
3. PC3 - Self-luminosity: the "clear light" of primordial awareness
4. PC4 - Introspective Availability: can we introspect on our current mental state
5. PC5 - Epistemicity: feeling of knowing or subjective quality of confidence (doesn't logically entail actual knowledge)
6. PC6 - Transparency/Opacity: transparent means only intentional-content properties of the state can be introspected whereas opacity means properties of the carrier/vehicle of the state can also be introspected

### Ascending Reticular Activating System (ARAS)
This system determines the brain's general level of activation.

Pure awareness is experienced as "contentless" although it is actually a representation of ARAS

This model is [physicalist](thoughts/Materialism.md) (awareness-as-such is constituted by the brain) and representationalist (awareness-as-such is a neurally constituted representation of the brain's auto-activated wakefulness -- character is tonic alertness with a feeling of knowing)
