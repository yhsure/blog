Money is power. It dictates what type of research and work gets funded, and who gets to do it. 

As of now, there are no good spaces to work on long-term (think 10+ years in the future) research to enable the visions of the future.

Can we move away from depending completely on only one of 
1. Government funding
2. Market Influence
3. Academia

Some thoughts. Already have been thinking about this in relation to [hackathons](posts/hackathons.md), [paid open source](posts/paid-open-source.md), and [academia](thoughts/academia.md).

### New Science

> New Science will create a network of new scientific institutes pursuing basic research while not being dependent on universities, the NIH, and the rest of traditional academia and, importantly, not being dominated culturally by academia.

Their plan is to not replace traditional academic institutions, but to develop alternative/complementary ones to provide 'competitive pressures' on existing ones. New Science is to research as Silicon Valley was to entrepreneurship.

Incentive and organizational structures are not everything.  You can copy all of the US’s laws and structures of government and this will absolutely not lead to your country’s GDP per capita suddenly (or ever) jumping to $60k/year. Similar things can be said about research organizations.

"Instead, I believe that the most promising way to achieve large-scale improvement in the way basic scientific research is organized is to start small, help individual scientists, and to make [small steps towards a much better world](https://marginalrevolution.com/)." Is this potentially good justification for [minigrants](thoughts/project-list.md)?

Themes of research generally surround complex systems and a more system-based approach to analyzing and learning about the world: https://www.santafe.edu/research/themes

> Computers were becoming more powerful, and some scientists began to dream of a day when they might simulate highly complex systems, even living systems, in silico.

"We weren’t disillusioned," [Pines, the SFI Co-founder] says. "But we recognized that [universities](thoughts/academia.md) were ill-equipped to nurture emerging new fields, and we were thinking about how we could help them grow. If we could create an institution where they could flourish, we thought we could make a difference."

> All we needed was a few million dollars, a building, a staff, and a great deal of luck... The key was simply to create a refuge for brilliant scholars to interact in an environment that was free from boundaries – what one collaborator many years later called “a spa for the brain.”
