> Language is the systematic and conventional use of sounds (or signs or written symbols) for the purpose of communication or self expression (Crystal, 1995 as cited in Hoff 2014:4)

## LING222
- Uses both iconic and symbolic representations
	- Iconic: direct connection between the sound/shape/look of a word and its meaning
	- Symbolic: no connection between the sound/shape/look of a word and its meaning
- Children learn language through exposure to language, not through being taught explicit rules
- Learning of a **productive grammar** that can generate (or produce) an infinite number of phrases that others can understand
- Language is shaped by social factors -- specifically its speakers
	- Language must be learned through exposure, and the language you learn is based on the language you hear/see (input)
- Involves knowledge of 
	- Sounds (phonetics)
	- Words (phonology, semantics)
	- Grammar (morphology, syntax)
	- Social and communicative Function (pragmatics)
- Productivity: you can come up with (or generate) new words and sentences, even if you have never said them before
- Comprehension: you can understand infinite combinations of morphemes and
words, even if you have never heard them before
### Components of Language Knowledge
- Phonetics: how to produce/pronounce sounds or signs, how we hear sounds
- Phonology: which sounds are used in language, how sounds are combined to form words
- Morphology: the system for combining units of meaning
- Syntax: how are words combined, is a sentence grammatical
- Semantics: what do words or sentences mean
	- Semantic organization: organizing the world between cognitive organization and language
- Pragmatics: how do you use the language in communication and conversation
	- Pragmatic principles: principles about how language is used
		- Principle of conventionality: the meaning of a word is determined by convention
		- Principle of contrast: different words have different meanings (different from mutual-exclusivity as dog and animal are valid labels here)
- Sociolinguistics: knowledge of socially appropriate use of language
### Approaches to study of language development
- Language socialization: A description of children’s language use in social contexts and an account of the social processes by which children come to use language in the manner of their culture
- Linguistic: the Language Acquisition Device (LAD) must contain some knowledge of the structure of language in order for language acquisition to be possible -- this innate knowledge cannot be specific to any particular language thus it is a Universal Grammar (UG)
- Learnability approach: focuses on explaining the fact that language is acquired (i.e., that language is learnable).
- Developmental approach: focuses on explaining the course of language development.
### Nature vs Nurture
- Is the development of language in children the result of human innate knowledge (e.g. walking upright) or is it the result of the experiences of children and how they are raised (e.g. learning calculus)?
- Empiricism: the mind at birth is like a blank slate; all knowledge and reason come from experience
- Nativism: knowledge cannot come from experience alone. The mind must have some preexisting structure in order to organize and interpret experience 
- Interactionism/constructivist: acknowledges there must be some innate characteristics of the mind that allow it to develop language based on experience but places greater emphasis on accounting for children's language-learning experiences
### Cognitivism vs Behaviourism
- Behaviourism: change in behaviour occurs in response to the consequences of prior behaviour; behaviour can be fully accounted for in terms of things external to the mind
- Cognitivism: we cannot understand behaviour without understanding what is going on inside the mind of the organism producing the behaviour
### Nature vs. Nurture
- Nativism (nature): innate knowledge underlies language, focus on the ease/speed  
that children learn language without formal instruction (maturation)  
- Empiricism (nurture): everything comes from experience (learning)
	- We know that human children who are not exposed to language early in their lives do not reach the same proficiency in adulthood
### Critical Period
- Critical period hypothesis: language must be learned within a biologically determined window (comparable to birds and imprinting)
- Sometimes also called the sensitive period or optimal period (less sensitive than critical period)
### Measuring sound discrimination
- Prosody: includes learning about the intonation, stress, pitch of a language.
- Categorical perception: when a range of stimuli that differ continuously are perceived as belonging to only a few categories 
- Phoneme Boundary Effect: example of categorical perception. e.g. the phonemes /b/ and /p/ differ along a single acoustic continuum (voice onset time), but listeners hear each stimulus as either a /b/ or a /p/, nothing in between
- Distributional learning: learning from simply being exposed to frequency distributions of speech sounds in one's surroundings
- Statistical learning: learning by counting the frequency with which one stimulus is followed by another
- Rule learning: a stronger claim than statistical learning, claims that babies can learn a pattern that must be described in terms of symbols (or variables) that stand for any sound. Babies learn algebraic rules, not just statistical regularities
- Phonological bootstrapping hypothesis: children use phonological cues (e.g. nouns tend to have first-syllable stress whereas verbs have second-syllable stress) to break into grammatical structure 
- Prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis: pauses and changes in intonation at phrase boundaries
### 5 stages in early speech production
1. Reflexive Crying and Vegetative Sounds
	1. Burps, sneezes, anything that accompanies biological functions
2. Cooing and Laughter (elicited by social interaction)
3. Vocal Play or Expansion Stage
	1. In first few months, the only recognizable speech sounds are vowel-like. The first recognizable consonant-like sounds are heard at around 2 to 3 months of age, and tend to be back of the mouth (velars), such as [g] and [k].
4. Reduplicated Babbling (e.g. bababa)
	1. Deaf child also babble but at a later time than other children. The number of sounds produced gets smaller (not larger) over time.
5. Non-Reduplicated/Variegated Babbling (e.g. bagiga)
	1. Wordless sentences are often referred to as jargon
- Impacts of experience in speech production
	- Input from adults – affects sounds and prosody in babbling. This is also influenced by the language that they hear (babbling drift)
	- Vocal feedback from own productions  
	- Social feedback
### Phoneme Acquisition Time
- Why are some phonemes acquired later than others?  
	- Ease of articulation  
	- Frequency in the input  
	- Markedness  
	- Functional load – how many words in the language use this sound?
- Early: /p/, /b/, /d/, /m/, /n/, /j/, /w/, /h/
- Middle: /t/, /k/, /g/, /f/, /v/, /tʃ/, /ŋ/, /dʒ/
- Late: /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /l/, /r/
### Experimental approaches for studying infant's perception
- Cross-language speech perception: see Werker & Tees
- High-amplitude Sucking Technique
	- Babies like to hear sounds
	- Babies lose interest in a sound when it is presented repeatedly (habituation)
	- Babies who have lost interest in a previously repeated sound will become interested if a new sound is presented (dishabituation)
	- Works best for <0;4
- Conditioned Head Turn Procedure
	- Babies are interested in moving toys
	- Using the presentation of the moving toy as a reward, babies can be trained to turn their heads when they hear a change in a sound being presented
	- Works best for 0;5-1;0
- Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm
	- Placing a child on their mother's lap in front of two video monitors, which play two different events simultaneously.
	- A speaker between the two monitors plays a verbal sentence that matches only one of the videos.
	- A hidden observer measures how much the child looks at each screen.
	- If the child watches the correct monitor longer and more quickly than the incorrect monitor, they are deemed to have understood the sentence.
### Sounds
- Phones: different sounds a language uses
- Phonemes: meaningfully different sounds in a given language
- Allophones: phones that do not differentiate meaning
- Phonotactic knowledge: knowledge of constraints on the sequencing of sounds 
- Voicing: whether vocal folds vibrate (e.g. /s/ is voiceless, /z/ is voiced)
- Place of articulation: where the vocal tract is closed
- Manner of articulation: how the vocal tract is closed
	- Stops: completely stop the airflow
	- Fricative: not completely stopped
- Articulatory phonetics: describing speech sounds in terms of how they are produced
- Phonetic features: axes of different features for sounds (e.g. voicing, place of articulation, etc.)
- Phonological idioms: words the child produces in a very adultlike way, while still incorrectly producing other words that use the very same sounds
- Phonological processes: systematic ways in which to alter the sounds of the target language so that they fit within the repertoire of sounds they can produce
- Canonical form: preexisting whole-word sound pattern (e.g. consonant + vowel + /j/ + vowel + consonant)
- Articulatory complexity: types of sounds (or sound sequences) that lead individuals with articulatory deficits to make errors
- Functional load: importance of certain features in making distinctions
- Phonological awareness: awareness of and ability to work with sounds in spoken language
- Phonological memory: the ability to remember a sequence of unfamiliar sounds
- Speech segmentation problem: how do children find word boundaries in a stream of speech
### Lexical Development
- Mental lexicon: mental dictionary of word knowledge (how it sounds, grammar, definition, etc.)
- Word: symbol that refers to something
- Symbol: stands for something without being a part of that something
- Context-bound word: things tied to particular contexts (word use is more specific than actual meaning)
- Nominals: names for things
- Natural partitions hypothesis: the physical world makes obvious the things that take nouns as labels, whereas the meanings that verbs encode have to be figured out from hearing the verb in use
- Relational relativity hypothesis: possibility that verb meanings will vary from language to language (linguistic work showing that noun meanings are more similar across languages than are verb meanings)
- Word extension: to what extent is a word valid?
	- Underextensions: using words in a more restricted fashion
	- Overextensions: using words in a more broad fashion (for related study, see Naigles & Gelman 1995 study, results showed that overextensions are mistakes, they don’t indicate incorrect understanding of the words)
	- Protowords (also known as phonetically consistent forms -- PCFs)
		- Phonetically consistent: the child uses the same word every time.
	- Things that help with accurate word extension:
		- Taxonomic extension: words to things are actually taxonomies (they are of the same category)
- Word spurt: see Choi & Gopnik (1995)
- Types of language use, two ends of a continuum
	- Referential language style: more object labels
	- Expressive language style: relatively fewer object object labels and more personal/social words
- Mapping problem: how do we know what the new word refers to?
	- Fast mapping: initial hypothesis about word meaning
	- Lexical principles/lexical constraints: guides that limit possible interpretations of new words
		- Whole-object assumption: words refer to whole objects
		- Assumption of mutual exclusivity: different words refer to different kinds of things. No category overlap
	- Lexical gaps: Sometimes things are not a one-to-one match – your language may not have a lexical item for something
- Syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis: knowledge of language structure is generally useful for learning new verbs
	- If we know what the syntactic structure of the language is, it is easier to figure out the meaning of a new word
- Age at which children learn early words (first 50-100) can vary a lot due to
	- Environmental Factors
		- Language experience and input
		- Socioeconomic status (SES)
		- Birth order
	- Individual Factors
		- Processing speed
		- Phonological memory
		- Personality and temperament
### Learning Syntax
- Motherese/infant-directed speech (IDS)/child-directed speech (CDS), when talking to babies, adults use a higher-pitched voice, a wider range of pitches, longer pauses, and shorter phrases. Vowels are not only longer in duration, but also are more prototypical examples of the particular vowel being produced
	- Generally more straightforward - focused on here and now, directs joint attention, and connects to real world referents
	- Lots of repetition for new lexical items
	- Helps with language acquisition
- Negative evidence: correcting overgeneralizations
	- There is no negative evidence in the speech stream without explicit feedback
- Cross-situational learning: computing correlations between hearing a word and experiencing its referent (see Smith & Yu 2008 for related study on whether cross-situational learning is a possible explanation for how children learn words)
- Prescriptive grammar: dictates how people should speak, gives rules and grammar based around a “standard” or “correct” way of speaking, ignoring variation between dialects or between different demographics of people
- Descriptive grammar: we want to describe how people actually speak, not how we think they should speak
- Measurables
	- Longest utterance
	- Average utterance (mean length of utterance or MLU)
	- Kinds of sentences the child can produce
- Stages of development
	- Stage I (MLU 1.01 to 1.99): earliest word combinations
	- Stage II (MLU 2.00 to 2.49): grammatical morphemes start showing up
	- Stage III (MLU 2.50 to 2.99): varied simple sentences
	- Stage IV (MLU 3.00 and up): varied complex sentences
	- Stage V: new complex sentences
- Open-class words: nouns, verbs, adjectives (can be added to)
- Closed-class words: auxiliaries, prepositions, complementizers, determiners (usually fixed in language)
- Sentence types
	- Declarative (statement): “that’s a doggie”
	- Imperative (command): “look at the doggie”
	- Interrogative (question): yes/no questions
	- Negative sentences: contain negation
	- Complex sentences: contain more than one main verb
- Hirsch-Pasek and Golinkoff (1996): word order comprehension study. Do children know about subjects vs. objects and word order? 
- Two theories of syntax
	- Innate/generative: children do not "learn" anything specific for a given language, they already have a universal grammar (UG), they learn language-specific parameters to the UG
	- Experience-based/constructivist: grammatical knowledge comes completely from experience
### Learning Morphology
- Morpheme: the smallest unit of meaning in a language
	- Free morphemes can occur alone
	- Bound morphemes cannot
- Order of acquisition of phonemes (Brown 1973)
	- Morphemes come in in a consistent order (within a language)
	- The order is predicted based on a variety of factors, including the salience and consistency of form-meaning mapping
	- Same factors can predict differences between languages (in languages with more salient affixes and consistent form-meaning mappings children learn the morphology earlier)
- The U-shaped curve
	1. Rote memorization (child stores the forms they hear) – higher accuracy
	2. Rule acquired and over-applied – lower accuracy
	3. Rule acquired but children also know there are exceptions – higher accuracy
### Learning Pragmatics
- Linguistic competence: ability to use language in grammatical ways, including in production and comprehension
- Communicative competence: ability to use languages in manners that are appropriate for a given conversation, communicative goal, or social setting.
- Intentionality is actually a bigger question with respect to language acquisition: is the child intending to communicate?
	- Early vegetative noises are not communicative acts, but they can be for adults (e.g., an intentional yawn to express boredom).
- Three phases
	- Perlocutionary Phase (0;0-0;10): what I do/say has an effect on other people
	- Illocutionary Phase (0;10-1;0): I can use what I do/say to communicate with other people
	- Locutionary Phase (1;0+): I can use language (words used referentially and within well-formed sentences) in my communication
- Conversational ability
	- Connected discourse: communication involving multiple sentences or utterances in a longer time period
	- Grice (1957, 1985): two rules to be a good conversationalist
		- Take turns
			- Very young children (preschoolers and young school age) have longer pauses between turns and less overlapping speech than adults have. They are not as good (as adults) at using words like and, and then, or um to indicate they are not finished talking.
		- Be cooperative, optimize for
			- Quantity: Make your contribution as informative as is required; provide neither too much nor too little information
			- Quality: Try to make your contribution one that is true; do not say what you believe to be false or that for which you lack adequate evidence
			- Relation: Be relevant
			- Manner: Be perspicuous (i.e., be clear—brief, orderly, unambiguous)
- Theories about early conversation
	- Piaget: child does not have the skill and will for conversation yet
	- Vygotsky: speech serves a different function for children at early stages
### Learning Sociolinguistics
- Sociolinguistic development: how children learn to use their languages in socially appropriate ways that reflect their status in the community and the social context
- Constrained variation: distribution of a variant is not random or free, there are systematic correlations with independent factors.
- Free variation: accounts for cases where some variants seem to alternate with each other without any reliable constraints in a particular context or when used by a certain speaker
- Interspeaker: variation occurs between different speakers within or across speech communities
- Intraspeaker: variation occurs between within a single speaker, but might depend on interlocutors and context (= inherent variability)
- Group differentiation: social/regional varieties index (mark) group boundaries
- Language: not mutually intelligible communication systems
- Dialect: mutually intelligible, but have differences in sentence structure (syntax), how words are made (morphology), or word choice (lexicon)
- Accent: mutually intelligible, only have differences in phonology (sounds)
- Variation factors
	- Speaker-driven factors
	- Audience-driven factors
	- Task-related factors
	- Linguistic factors
- Ochs (1985)
	- How are phonological registers, word order, and ergativity acquired by children learning Samoan (and how does their speech compare to adult patterns)?
		- Children use features of both registers even at one word stage, but do not show recognition of appropriate contexts until multi-word stage (2- 2.5 years), children start producing tautala lelei first and then tautala leaga
	- Ergativity acquired relatively late, appears to match a sociolinguistic norm in the community
- Types of time
	- Real Time: chronological time based on year
	- Apparent Time: an estimate of time based on speaker age or date of birth
	- When we look at a speaker age as a proxy for time, we must make assumptions what things are stable in language and at what ages.
