> Language is the systematic and conventional use of sounds (or signs or written symbols) for the purpose of communication or self expression (Crystal, 1995 as cited in Hoff 2014:4)

## LING222
- Uses both iconic and symbolic representations
	- Iconic: direct connection between the sound/shape/look of a word and its meaning
	- Symbolic: no connection between the sound/shape/look of a word and its meaning
- Children learn language through exposure to language, not through being taught explicit rules
- Learning of a **productive grammar** that can generate (or produce) an infinite number of phrases that others can understand
- Language is shaped by social factors -- specifically its speakers
	- Language must be learned through exposure, and the language you learn is based on the language you hear/see (input)
- Involves knowledge of 
	- Sounds (phonetics)
	- Words (phonology, semantics)
	- Grammar (morphology, syntax)
	- Social and communicative Function (pragmatics)
### Parts of language
- Phonetics: how to produce/pronounce sounds or signs, how we hear sounds
- Phonology: which sounds are used in language, how sounds are combined to form words
- Morphology: what do words look like in the language, what are the different types of words
- Syntax: how are words combined, is a sentence grammatical
- Semantics: what do words or sentences mean
- Pragmatics: how do you use the language in communication and conversation
### Nature vs. Nurture
- Nativism (nature): innate knowledge underlies language, focus on the ease/speed  
that children learn language without formal instruction (maturation)  
- Empiricism (nurture): everything comes from experience (learning)
	- We know that human children who are not exposed to language early in their lives do not reach the same proficiency in adulthood
### Critical Period
- Critical period hypothesis: language must be learned within a biologically determined window (comparable to birds and imprinting)
### Definitions
- Phonemes are sounds that can make a difference in meaning
- Allophones are sounds that do not make a difference in meaning
### Measuring sound discrimination
- Children become bored or inattentive to the sounds (habituated). Children hear a new sound and their response is measured. 
- Prosody: includes learning about the intonation, stress, pitch of a language.
### 5 stages in early speech production
1. Reflexive Crying and Vegetative Sounds  
2. Cooing and Laughter  
3. Vocal Play  
4. Reduplicated Babbling (e.g. bababa)
	1. Deaf child also babble but at a later time than other children. The number of sounds produced gets smaller (not larger) over time.
5. Non-Reduplicated Babbling (e.g. bagiga)

- Impacts of experience in speech production
	- Input from adults – affects sounds and prosody in babbling  
	- Vocal feedback from own productions  
	- Social feedback
### Phoneme Acquisition Time
- Why are some phonemes acquired later than others?  
	- Ease of articulation  
	- Frequency in the input  
	- Markedness  
	- Functional load – how many words in the language use this sound?
- Early: /p/, /b/, /d/, /m/, /n/, /j/, /w/, /h/
- Middle: /t/, /k/, /g/, /f/, /v/, /tʃ/, /ŋ/, /dʒ/
- Late: /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /l/, /r/
