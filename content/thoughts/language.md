> Language is the systematic and conventional use of sounds (or signs or written symbols) for the purpose of communication or self expression (Crystal, 1995 as cited in Hoff 2014:4)

## LING222
- Uses both iconic and symbolic representations
	- Iconic: direct connection between the sound/shape/look of a word and its meaning
	- Symbolic: no connection between the sound/shape/look of a word and its meaning
- Children learn language through exposure to language, not through being taught explicit rules
- Learning of a **productive grammar** that can generate (or produce) an infinite number of phrases that others can understand
- Language is shaped by social factors -- specifically its speakers
	- Language must be learned through exposure, and the language you learn is based on the language you hear/see (input)
- Involves knowledge of 
	- Sounds (phonetics)
	- Words (phonology, semantics)
	- Grammar (morphology, syntax)
	- Social and communicative Function (pragmatics)
### Components of Language Knowledge
- Phonetics: how to produce/pronounce sounds or signs, how we hear sounds
- Phonology: which sounds are used in language, how sounds are combined to form words
- Morphology: the system for combining units of meaning
- Syntax: how are words combined, is a sentence grammatical
- Semantics: what do words or sentences mean
	- Semantic organization: organizing the world between cognitive organization and language
- Pragmatics: how do you use the language in communication and conversation
	- Pragmatic principles: principles about how language is used
		- Principle of conventionality: the meaning of a word is determined by convention
		- Principle of contrast: different words have different meanings (different from mutual-exclusivity as dog and animal are valid labels here)
- Sociolinguistics: knowledge of socially appropriate use of language
### Approaches to study of language development
- Language socialization: A description of children’s language use in social contexts and an account of the social processes by which children come to use language in the manner of their culture
- Linguistic: the Language Acquisition Device (LAD) must contain some knowledge of the structure of language in order for language acquisition to be possible -- this innate knowledge cannot be specific to any particular language thus it is a Universal Grammar (UG)
- Learnability approach: focuses on explaining the fact that language is acquired (i.e., that language is learnable).
- Developmental approach: focuses on explaining the course of language development.
### Nature vs Nurture
- Is the development of language in children the result of human innate knowledge (e.g. walking upright) or is it the result of the experiences of children and how they are raised (e.g. learning calculus)?
- Empiricism: the mind at birth is like a blank slate; all knowledge and reason come from experience
- Nativism: knowledge cannot come from experience alone. The mind must have some preexisting structure in order to organize and interpret experience 
- Interactionism/constructivist: acknowledges there must be some innate characteristics of the mind that allow it to develop language based on experience but places greater emphasis on accounting for children's language-learning experiences
### Cognitivism vs Behaviourism
- Behaviourism: change in behaviour occurs in response to the consequences of prior behaviour; behaviour can be fully accounted for in terms of things external to the mind
- Cognitivism: we cannot understand behaviour without understanding what is going on inside the mind of the organism producing the behaviour
### Nature vs. Nurture
- Nativism (nature): innate knowledge underlies language, focus on the ease/speed  
that children learn language without formal instruction (maturation)  
- Empiricism (nurture): everything comes from experience (learning)
	- We know that human children who are not exposed to language early in their lives do not reach the same proficiency in adulthood
### Critical Period
- Critical period hypothesis: language must be learned within a biologically determined window (comparable to birds and imprinting)
- Sometimes also called the sensitive period or optimal period (less sensitive than critical period)
### Measuring sound discrimination
- Prosody: includes learning about the intonation, stress, pitch of a language.
- Categorical perception: when a range of stimuli that differ continuously are perceived as belonging to only a few categories 
- Phoneme Boundary Effect: example of categorical perception. e.g. the phonemes /b/ and /p/ differ along a single acoustic continuum (voice onset time), but listeners hear each stimulus as either a /b/ or a /p/, nothing in between
- Distributional learning: learning from simply being exposed to frequency distributions of speech sounds in one's surroundings
- Statistical learning: learning by counting the frequency with which one stimulus is followed by another
- Rule learning: a stronger claim than statistical learning, claims that babies can learn a pattern that must be described in terms of symbols (or variables) that stand for any sound. Babies learn algebraic rules, not just statistical regularities
- Phonological bootstrapping hypothesis: children use phonological cues (e.g. nouns tend to have first-syllable stress whereas verbs have second-syllable stress) to break into grammatical structure 
- Prosodic bootstrapping hypothesis: pauses and changes in intonation at phrase boundaries
- Child-directed speech: aka motherese, when talking to babies, adults use a higher-pitched voice, a wider range of pitches, longer pauses, and shorter phrases. Vowels are not only longer in duration, but also are more prototypical examples of the particular vowel being produced
- Negative evidence: correcting overgeneralizations
### 5 stages in early speech production
1. Reflexive Crying and Vegetative Sounds
	1. Burps, sneezes, anything that accompanies biological functions
2. Cooing and Laughter (elicited by social interaction)
3. Vocal Play or Expansion Stage
	1. In first few months, the only recognizable speech sounds are vowel-like. The first recognizable consonant-like sounds are heard at around 2 to 3 months of age, and tend to be back of the mouth (velars), such as [g] and [k].
4. Reduplicated Babbling (e.g. bababa)
	1. Deaf child also babble but at a later time than other children. The number of sounds produced gets smaller (not larger) over time.
5. Non-Reduplicated/Variegated Babbling (e.g. bagiga)
	1. Wordless sentences are often referred to as jargon
- Impacts of experience in speech production
	- Input from adults – affects sounds and prosody in babbling. This is also influenced by the language that they hear (babbling drift)
	- Vocal feedback from own productions  
	- Social feedback
### Phoneme Acquisition Time
- Why are some phonemes acquired later than others?  
	- Ease of articulation  
	- Frequency in the input  
	- Markedness  
	- Functional load – how many words in the language use this sound?
- Early: /p/, /b/, /d/, /m/, /n/, /j/, /w/, /h/
- Middle: /t/, /k/, /g/, /f/, /v/, /tʃ/, /ŋ/, /dʒ/
- Late: /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /l/, /r/
### Experimental approaches for studying infant's perception
- Cross-language speech perception: see Werker & Tees
- High-amplitude Sucking Technique
	- Babies like to hear sounds
	- Babies lose interest in a sound when it is presented repeatedly (habituation)
	- Babies who have lost interest in a previously repeated sound will become interested if a new sound is presented (dishabituation)
	- Works best for <0;4
- Conditioned Head Turn Procedure
	- Babies are interested in moving toys
	- Using the presentation of the moving toy as a reward, babies can be trained to turn their heads when they hear a change in a sound being presented
	- Works best for 0;5-1;0
- Intermodal Preferential Looking Paradigm
	- Placing a child on their mother's lap in front of two video monitors, which play two different events simultaneously.
	- A speaker between the two monitors plays a verbal sentence that matches only one of the videos.
	- A hidden observer measures how much the child looks at each screen.
	- If the child watches the correct monitor longer and more quickly than the incorrect monitor, they are deemed to have understood the sentence.
### Sounds
- Phones: different sounds a language uses
- Phonemes: meaningfully different sounds in a given language
- Allophones: phones that do not differentiate meaning
- Phonotactic knowledge: knowledge of constraints on the sequencing of sounds 
- Voicing: whether vocal folds vibrate (e.g. /s/ is voiceless, /z/ is voiced)
- Place of articulation: where the vocal tract is closed
- Manner of articulation: how the vocal tract is closed
	- Stops: completely stop the airflow
	- Fricative: not completely stopped
- Articulatory phonetics: describing speech sounds in terms of how they are produced
- Phonetic features: axes of different features for sounds (e.g. voicing, place of articulation, etc.)
- Phonological idioms: words the child produces in a very adultlike way, while still incorrectly producing other words that use the very same sounds
- Phonological processes: systematic ways in which to alter the sounds of the target language so that they fit within the repertoire of sounds they can produce
- Canonical form: preexisting whole-word sound pattern (e.g. consonant + vowel + /j/ + vowel + consonant)
- Articulatory complexity: types of sounds (or sound sequences) that lead individuals with articulatory deficits to make errors
- Functional load: importance of certain features in making distinctions
- Phonological awareness: awareness of and ability to work with sounds in spoken language
- Phonological memory: the ability to remember a sequence of unfamiliar sounds
- Speech segmentation problem: how do children find word boundaries in a stream of speech
### Lexical Development
- Mental lexicon: mental dictionary of word knowledge (how it sounds, grammar, definition, etc.)
- Word: symbol that refers to something
- Symbol: stands for something without being a part of that something
- Context-bound word: things tied to particular contexts (word use is more specific than actual meaning)
- Nominals: names for things
- Natural partitions hypothesis: the physical world makes obvious the things that take nouns as labels, whereas the meanings that verbs encode have to be figured out from hearing the verb in use
- Relational relativity hypothesis: possibility that verb meanings will vary from language to language (linguistic work showing that noun meanings are more similar across languages than are verb meanings)
- Word extension: to what extent is a word valid?
	- Underextensions: using words in a more restricted fashion
	- Overextensions: using words in a more broad fashion
	- Things that help with accurate word extension:
		- Taxonomic extension: words to things are actually taxonomies (they are of the same category)
- Word spurt: see Choi & Gopnik (1995)
- Types of language use, two ends of a continuum
	- Referential language style: more object labels
	- Expressive language style: relatively fewer object object labels and more personal/social words
- Mapping problem: how do we know what the new word refers to?
	- Fast mapping: initial hypothesis about word meaning
	- Lexical principles/lexical constraints: guides that limit possible interpretations of new words
		- Whole-object assumption: words refer to whole objects
		- Assumption of mutual exclusivity: different words refer to different kinds of things. No category overlap
- Syntactic bootstrapping hypothesis: knowledge of language structure is generally useful for learning new verbs
