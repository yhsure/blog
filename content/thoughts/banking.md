T account or balance sheet-style thinking is a banker's way of being able to hold complementary opposites and demand in mind.

### Printing Money
It's often not correct to say that when the Fed is 'printing money' they are straight up just injecting into one side. Most times, it expands *both sides of the balance sheet*.

### Prices of Money
1. Interest Rate (future) -- price of money now in terms of price of money later
2. Part (now) -- price of one money in terms of another money (e.g. between states, between private and central bank)
3. Exchange Rate (foreign) -- price of domestic money in terms of foreign/world money
4. Price level (commodities) -- price of money in terms of price level of commodities
