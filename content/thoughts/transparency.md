The process of identifying users is how social media platforms monetize their operations

Big companies avoid fully detailing how they identify and categorize uses, claiming that the information is "proprietary".

"They argue, this surveillance allows them ways to minimize the gamification of the social media system by disruptive actors, and by segmentation and differentiation, they may better protect the authentic user from the inauthentic."

## ACM Principles for Algorithmic Transparency and Accountability
- Awareness: stakeholders of analytic systems should be aware of the biases + risks + potential harms their design, implementation, and use could cause
- Access and redress: encourage the adoption of mechanisms that allow questioning by and remediation for groups adversely affected by algorithmic decision making systems
- Accountability: institutions should be held responsible for decisions made by their algorithms, even if how the model arrived at its results is inexplicable
- Explanation: systems are encouraged to produce explanations of model output (regarding both procedures followed by algorithm as well as decisions made)
- Data Provenance: describe how the data was collected and should be maintained, along with an exploration of the potential biases induced by the data gathering process
- Auditability: models, algorithms, data, and decisions should be recorded so that they can be audited in cases where harm is suspected
- Validation + Testing: institutions should routinely use rigorous methods to validate their models (against discriminatory harm for example) and documents those methods.
