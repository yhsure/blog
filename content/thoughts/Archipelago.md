*by Ã‰douard Glissant*

A beautiful dialogue between Glissand and the curator Hans Ulrish Obrist.

> I can change through exchanging with others, without losing or diluting my sense of self.

## Globality versus Globalization
- Globality does not homogenize culture. It produces a difference from which new things can emerge. (22)
- Globalization standardizes and dilutes. It reduces communities to a single model, attacking them from the top down, diminishing them.

## Archipelagos
- "a world of many worlds" as quoted by the Chiapas
	- they desire a *creole* -- a mixed Mexico
- Creolization is the means by which several distinct cultures or their elements, come into contact in a particular place in the world ([contact languages](thoughts/contact%20language.md) enable this)
- Distinction between multiethnic (where many cultures exist but are distinct) and creole (where many cultures mix and form new ones)
