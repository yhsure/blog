# Dennet
## Frame problem of AI
-   coined by McCarthy and Hayes → particular narrowly conceived problem about representation
-   call the broader problem "the whole pudding"
-   will refer to "the whole pudding" as the frame problem
-   intelligence is (at least partly) a matter of using well what you know
    -   an intelligent being learns from experience, and then uses what is has learned to guide expectations in the futrue
-   hume believed that we 'think before we leap' because of associationism → certain transition paths between ideas grew more likely-to-be-followed as they became well worn
    -   dennet thinks this is flawed, hume operates at a purely semantic level (phenomenological level), one assumes that items behave as items with those meanings ought to behave
-   hetero-phenomenologist → one reasons about what the agent must know or figure out either unconsciously or consciously in order to perform various tasks
    -   AI → is formulated tabula rasa (from scratch, no knowledge about the the world)
    -   everything either needs to be impressed by
        -   programmer at the outset
        -   subsequent learning by the system

## Installation problem
problem of installing in one way or another all the information needed by an agent to plan in a changing world
-   can be broken down into
	-   semantic problem → what information do we need to install?
	-   syntactic problem → what system, format, structure, or mechanism do we use to install it
-   cannot realistically create a spinozistic solution → a small set of axioms and definitions from which we can deduce the rest of our knowledge on demand
-   'force of habit' errors → stereotypical routines reveal themselves to be surprisingly insensitive to some portentous environmental changes while surprisingly sensitive to others
-   problem of induction → give that i believe all of this (have all this evidence) what ought I to believe as well (about the future, or about unexamined parts of the world)?
-   we need a system that genuinely ignores most of what it knows and operate with a well-chosen portion of its knowledge at any moment
    -   qualification problem → how do we design a system that reliably ignores what it ought to ignore under a wide variety of different circumstances in a complex action environment?
-   cognitive wheel → design proposal in cognitive theory that is profoundly unbiological, however wizardly and elegant is is as a bit of technology (e.g. wheels in birdas)
-   are all systems just a collection of cognitive wheels
    -   while AI can model some cognitive phenomena, it's not a 1:1 mapping all the way down
        -   at some point, that the level of intended modelling will consist of cognitive wheels
