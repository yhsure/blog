I like to consider the work I do _craft_ -- not necessarily in the explicit hand-made aspect of it -- but rather a celebration of the act of making itself. What follows is a list of things I'm proud to have made or helped contribute to with my own hands.

My (considerably longer) list of unfinished ideas can be found [here](thoughts/idea%20list.md). You can also find a list of things that didn't quite go so well in my [[posts/a-failure-resume|failure resume]].

## Web Poetics

- Community Lock Screen Collage, digital installation for [Kernel 4](https://www.kernelmag.io/issues/4) Launch Party (2024)
	- What would it be like to live with someone else's lock screen for a day? Participants are invited to upload their own lockscreen and download someone else's. The uploaded lockscreens are arranged to create a stylized version of the Kernel 4 cover.
	- This installation asks two separate questions: 1) what do people choose to hold onto and consciously pay attention to? 2) how might the personal be a touchstone of connection to create a larger collective whole?

- (we)bsite, website and digital home (2022)
	- A project with Spencer Chang in which we create a living collection of internet dreams from people like you, inhabitants of the internet. It aims to create space to hold, show, and uplift everyday visions and hopes for the internet.

## Open Source

- **ruspty** (2024)
	- Wrote large chunks of the core library code in Rust which allows consumers in Node.js and Bun to create [[thoughts/terminal|pseudoterminal]] file descriptors for forked processes.
	- This, in conjunction with River (below), allowed us to see a ~60x improvement in shell throughput. This means we can output all of Shakespeare's collected works in about ~1s instead of 67s!
	- Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/replit/ruspty)
	- ![[thoughts/images/shell-comparison.png]]
- **River** (2023)
	- Designed and implemented River, a framework for long-lived streaming Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) in modern web applications, featuring advanced error handling and customizable retry policies to ensure seamless communication between clients and servers. River is Replit's main communication protocol, powering the workspace editor and AI chat.

	- Created what is now Replit’s main Python LSP, invoked almost ~17M times per month. Led to a 13% improvement on 7 day retention and a 4x bump in code action acceptance rate (~3% to ~12%).

	- A simplified Automerge-like [[thoughts/CRDT|CRDT]] in Rust with ideas from Martin Kleppmann's 2022 paper on _Making CRDTs Byzantine Fault Tolerant_. The blog post also [hit #3 on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33694568) the day it was released and has been [featured in go-to resources for CRDTs](https://crdt.tech/).

- Distributed Press -- publishing websites to the [[thoughts/distributed web|distributed web]] (2022)
	- Architected a new version of Distributed Press, an open source publishing tool for the web that utilizes distributed peer-to-peer protocols to improve content discoverability and archivability. 
	- Implemented and tested the new rewrite to improve observability, performance, and security ([#31](https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/pull/31), [#32](https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/pull/32), [#35](https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/pull/35)). Wrote a custom [[thoughts/DNS|DNS]] server to resolve DNSLink queries for hosted sites ([#41](https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/pull/41)).

- Gesture -- hand-tracking as input device (2022)
	- An experimental proof-of-concept that uses hand-tracking as an input device to control a cursor in both 2D and 3D space. It exposes the hand pose information in one of two ways: 1) As a virtual mouse with click and hover and drag support 2) As raw input data, by connecting to a local Websocket server that streams the position data.

	- A lightweight (31.8kB) cursor chat à la Figma for digital co-existing + presence. An experiment in spatial software, [interaction design](thoughts/interaction%20design.md), and [digital commons](thoughts/digital%20commons.md). Built on top of [yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) and [perfect-cursors](https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-cursors).
	- Source: [GitHub](https://github.com/jackyzha0/cursor-chat), [Demo](https://jzhao.xyz/cursor-chat/)

- Telescopic Text -- open source library for expandable text (2022)
	- An open-source library to help with creating expandable text, inspired by [StretchText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StretchText) and [TelescopicText](https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC). It has been taught as a tool for creating writing classes at SFSU.
	- I've been thinking a lot about creating a browsable store of knowledge that provides something useful at all distance scales and concepts like Telescopic Text are a first step in creating more [[thoughts/information scales|information scales]] than just a single document level.

	- I left after graduating with strong opinions on [[posts/hackathons|hackathon culture]] and where to go from there.
