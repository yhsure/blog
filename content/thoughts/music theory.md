- Triad: root, third, fifth
- Intervals:
	- Half-step: generally the distance between two adjacent 'notes' on an instrument (keys on a piano or frets on a guitar) - this is normally 20Hz
	- Major third: 4 half-steps
	- Minor third: 3 half-steps
- Types of triads (1, 3, 5)
	- Major:
		- 1-3 is a major, 3-5 is a minor
	- Minor:
		- 1-3 is a minor, 3-5 is a major
		- Basically like a major but lower the third by a half-step
	- Augmented
		- 1-3 is a major, 3-5 is a major
		- Basically like a major but raise the fifth by a half-step
	- Diminished
		- 1-3 is a minor, 3-5 is a minor
		- Major but lower the third and fifth by a half-step
- 7th chord:
	- Major: major triad with a major third on top
	- Minor: minor triad with minor third on top
	- Dominant: major triad with a minor third on top
	- Suspended: major triad but replace the third
		- Sus4 (default for sus): replace with the fourth
		- Sus2: replace with the second
		- Sus7: replace with the seventh

	- Add 9 (can be modified with flat or sharp)
	- Add 11 (can be modified with flat or sharp)
