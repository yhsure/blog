why i always dislike introductions
* apply [labels](thoughts/quantization.md) to things too early
* people have expectations (oh so you're an artist? show me your work)
    * self-imposed as well
    * a bad amount of [idolization](thoughts/idolization.md)
    * as a side note, same reason why calling yourself a writer vs someone who writes are two very different vibes (i *dabble*)
* first of many experiences → why do we feel the need to get it right at the start?

## Intersectional Identities
> "A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups" -- -   Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)

Cooley imagined affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality and identity more accurately.

"These 'reciprocally constructing phenomena' that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression." Related: the matrix of domination and intersectional theory in [Design Justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md)

"It strikes me that these labels are more often conversation enders than conversation starters, attempts to reduce a vast complexity into a neat, little word, with the lossiest of compression algorithms."

We cheer for the clothes, not the people. As Feynman said, "honors is epaulets, honors is uniforms"

## Communication
[bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) of communication mediums
* 6 word story → baby shoes for sale, never worn
* creativity in interpretation
* low bandwidth mediums require interpretation
    * requires human interpretation
        * if its good, we refer to it as creativity
        * if its bad, we just call it heuristics
* will we ever get to a point where introductions become useless because we already know everything about each other?
	* what about pre-stalking people on social media before meeting them? is this just people projecting their identities?
