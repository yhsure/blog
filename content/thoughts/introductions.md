why i can never do good introductions
* apply [labels](/thoughts/labels-and-quantization) to things
* people have expectations
    * self-imposed as well
* first of many experiences → why do we feel the need to get it right at the start?

## Intersectional Identities
> "A man may be regarded as the point of intersection of an indefinite number of circles representing social groups" -- -   Cooley, Human Nature and the Social Order (1922)

Cooley imagined affiliations and interests as a system of coordinates, with each additional group determining one's individuality and identity more accurately.

"These 'reciprocally constructing phenomena' that may empower one person with increasing self-actualization, burden others with exponentially debilitating oppression." Related: the matrix of domination and intersectional theory in [Design Justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md)

"It strikes me that these labels are more often conversation enders than conversation starters, attempts to reduce a vast complexity into a neat, little word, with the lossiest of compression algorithms."

We cheer for the clothes, not the people. As Feynman said, "honors is epaulets, honors is uniforms"

## Idolization

* "You implicitly invalidate any struggles they have, and eschew their private life. Your praise becomes so diluted that it’s meaningless, just another reflex or polite gesture. And, god forbid they ever deviate from this god-like persona that you’ve created for them."
* feels like there is rarely any space to be vulnerable
	* no room for failure -> [a-failure-resume](/posts/a-failure-resume)
* impostor syndrome

## Communication
[bandwidth](thoughts/bandwidth.md) of communication mediums
* 6 word story → baby shoes for sale, never worn
* creativity in interpretation
* low bandwidth mediums require interpretation
    * requires human interpretation
        * if its good, we refer to it as creativity
        * if its bad, we just call it heuristics
* will we ever get to a point where introductions become useless because we already know everything about each other?
	* what about pre-stalking people on social media before meeting them? is this just people projecting their identities?
