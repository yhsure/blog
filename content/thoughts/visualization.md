Mostly from *Envisioning Information* by Edward R. Tufte

## High density visualization

> High-density designs allow viewers to select, to narrate, to recast and personalize data for their own uses.

The control of information is given over to *viewers*, not to editors, designers, or decorators

Thin data prompts suspicions: "What are they leaving out? Is that really everything they know? What are they hiding? Is that all they did?"

It is not how much information there is, but rather how effectively it is arranged.

**Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information**

### Colour
Fundamental uses of [[thoughts/colour]] in information design
- To label (colour as noun)
- To measure (colour as quantity)
- To represent or imitate reality (colour as representation)
- To enliven it decorate
