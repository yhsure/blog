Money is old. "We have yet to discover a civilization that didn't have money. So, we know it's at least as old as civilization."

Money is a language through which to communicate value. Then, was does this mean for [decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md)? No one should control the expression of economic value in exactly the same way that no one controls the meaning of words: they are arrived at consensually through common use.

what money is, how it is created, and who gets to distribute it goes to the very heart of the ways in which we are all incentivised to act

Incentives can be thought of as the [social, political and neurobiological primitives](thoughts/social-contracts.md) which define what kinds of behaviours we express.

> Programmable money provides utility which makes it much more than just money for the internet: **it turns it into the internet of money**.

## Master-slave vs Peer-to-peer
Difference between hierarchical and [decentralized](thoughts/decentralization.md) methods.

Question is "who is the slave"? Supposedly the those that need to follow the interfaces that the master dictates, there is no 'ownership'.

What does this mean in the context of efficiency in systems? Consensus takes a long time. Decentralized methods are hard to get right. Is the trade off worth it? At what point do we trade good user experience with rights of data ownership?
