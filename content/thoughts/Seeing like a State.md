Book by James C. Scott

*An account of the logic behind the failure of some of the great utopian social engineering schemes of the twentieth century.*

## Simplification
- Certain forms of knowledge and control require a narrowing of vision.
	- "The great advantage of such tunnel vision is that it brings into sharp focus certain limited aspects of an otherwise far more complex and unwieldy reality."
	- "This very simplification, in turn, makes the phenomenon at the centre of the field of vision more legible and hence more susceptible to careful measurement and calculation."
- Scientific, "fiscal forestry", and monocultures
	- In which the actual tree with its vast number of uses was replaced by an abstract tree representing a volume of lumber or firewood.
	- Purely, the state wanted to optimize the greatest possible constant volume of wood
	- "In the short run, this experiment in the radical simplification of the forest to a single commodity was a resounding success."
	- "But it was the whole world that lied 'outside the brackets' which returned to haunt this technical vision."
	- "The monoculture meant that the whole nutrient cycle got out of order and eventually was nearly stopped, representing a production loss of 20 to 30 percent. A new term, *Waldsterben* (forest death), entered the German vocabulary. An exceptionally complex process involving soil building, nutrient uptake, and symbiotic relations among fungi, insects, mammals, and flora was apparently disrupted with serious consequence."
	- "Monocultures are, as a rule, more fragile and hence more vulnerable to the stress of disease and weather than polycultures are"
- Standards
	- "Large-scale commercial exchange and long-distance trade tend to promote common standards of measurement."
	- But yet, most complexities of human life fail to be marshalled into a single regulatory code.
	- "Even in a particular locality, practices varied greatly from farm to farm and over time; any codification would be partly arbitrary and artificially static. To codify local practices was thus a profoundly political act."
	- "At the limit, there would be at least as many legal codes as there were communities"
- Cities
	- "For Jacobs, the city as a social organism is a living structure that is constantly changing and springing surprises. Its connections are so complex and dimly understood that planning always risks unknowingly cutting into its living tissue, thereby damaging or killing vital social processes."

## Informal Order
- Jane Jacobs' Sidewalk Terms
	- "Jacobs explains that when a friend used their apartment while she and her husband were away or when they didn't want to wait up for a late-arriving visitor, they would leave the key to their apartment with the deli owner, who had a special drawer for such keys and who held them for friends. She noted that every nearby mixed-used street had someone who played the same role: a grocer, candy-store owner, barber, butcher, dry cleaner, or bookshop owner/ This is one of the many public functions of private business. These services, Jacobs notes, are not the outgrowth of any deep friendship; they are the result of people being on what she calls 'sidewalk terms' with others... The city relies on the density of people who are on sidewalk terms with one another to maintain a modicum of public order... A person didn't think twice about asking someone to hold one's seat at the theatre, to watch a child while one goes to the restroom, or to keep an eye on a bike while one ducks into a deli to buy a sandwich"
