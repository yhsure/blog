One important advantage of startups over public goods is the possibility of an _exit_. Exits create [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md) for upfront funding, hiring, motivation and alignment through equity, a share in the exit. However, for nonprofits, FOSS, and public goods projects, this “light at the end of the tunnel” does not exist.

## Definitions
Public goods are
1. non-excludable: it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges
2. non-rivalrous:  it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around)

It costs the same to produce for one person as it is for everyone else, and one cannot prevent people from accessing this.

Static [open source](thoughts/books/oss.md) (code that anyone can copy off the internet) is an example of a public good. Another example of these are public [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) like roads (although not necessarily, if you have your drivers license revoked you may not be able to make use of the roads in the first place).

It seems only natural that online media archives and open digital [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) should qualify as well.

Yet, no matter their claim to universality, instantiations of public goods are always _local_. The public cannot contain everyone. Locality is created and felt through [shared space, time, or experience]. It requires synchronicity of experience, rel: [group-limits](thoughts/group-limits.md)

Club goods are excludable but non-rivalrous. A lot of more recent app launches (e.g. Dispo and Clubhouse) used waitlists to create 'fake scarcity' to transition from a public good to a club good.

Crypto protocols are one of the most compelling novel institutional forms, specifically deriving from their "public" qualities
1. unrestricted membership + participation
2. open APIs
3. transparent allocation of resources and pwoer

Yet not perfect
* Ownership of these resources are concentrated in a precious few (whales)
* The 'public' that this infrastructure serves is mostly decentralized finance
Both of these main tokeholders share one common concern: price

### 'Voice' in web3
"The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013)"

"The most consequential members of the crypto-public today are those who hold the most tokens, meaning even small holders are effectively removed from the conversation about what's in their benefit." Same concepts as [design justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md), we need to talk with and consider the marginalized peoples under existing systems of power so we can gain a deeper understanding of the public that we are building for and how to best serve them.

## Obessions with profit
Web3 supposed allows us to 'codify' the set of values that a public goods represents. Yet, in practice in web3, "little space has been made for different values to be discussed or enacted. Which is why, in the absence of ways to enact our shared values, we default to the lowest common denominator: profit."

The United States Dollar does not have a responsibility to profit its holders. A cryptocurrency is a monetary instrument, not a business.
