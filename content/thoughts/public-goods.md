Public goods are
1. non-excludable -> it’s extremely difficult to stop someone from using the good, like roads and bridges
2. non-rivalrous ->  it’s abundant, and one person’s use of the good doesn’t substantially reduce the amount left for someone else (e.g. there’s more than enough air to go around)

Static [open source](posts/paid-open-source.md) (code that anyone can copy off the internet) is an example of a public good. Another example of these are public [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) like roads (although not necessarily, if you have your drivers license revoked you may not be able to make use of the roads in the first place).

Club goods are excludable but non-rivalrous. A lot of more recent app launches (e.g. Dispo and Clubhouse) used waitlists to create 'fake scarcity' to transition from a public good to a club good.
