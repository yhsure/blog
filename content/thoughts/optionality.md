Optionality: the nature of accepting the possibilities of the unknown, to give every fractal self a chance to live.  _I’d much rather know, but then again, not-knowing keeps all the possibilities open. It keeps all the worlds alive._ [Source](https://reading.supply/@jessica/some-comfort-for-the-time-being-64k4Ml)

> "This individual has merely acquired stamps of approval and has acquired safety net upon safety net. These safety nets don’t end up enabling big risk-taking—individuals just become habitual acquirers of safety nets. The comfort of a high-paying job at a prestigious firm surrounded by smart people is simply too much to give up. When that happens, the dreams that those options were meant to enable slowly recede into the background. For a few, those destinations are in fact their dreams come true—but for every one of those, there are ten entrepreneurs, artists, and restaurateurs that get trapped in those institutions." -- [Mihir Desai on Optionality](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/)

As humans, we tend to love 'exploring' our possibilities more than 'exploiting' and diving deep/committing to what we already have -- we lean heavily toward explore in the [exploit explore](thoughts/exploit%20explore.md) tradeoff curve.

This is the [optionality fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/optionality-fallacy).

In a life like the one we live in where cause and consequence is extremely hard to distinguish due to the huge number of confounding variables, trial and error reigns supreme. Though, this doesn't mean trying everything really quickly and abandoning things if results don't manifest (ahem, talented kid burnout syndrome)

> Tinkering and experimenting is a more efficient investment of your time than following a set path of learning which assumes an intrinsic value in specific skills and ignores the non-linear way life works.

Maybe why humans constantly chase [prestige](thoughts/prestige.md): to keep doors open as a means of cross-disciplinary recognition.

## Paradox of Choice
Individuals are *more* likely to be stressed from a larger number of options as considering more choices requires more mental effort.
