Optionality: the nature of accepting the possibilities of the unknown, to give every fractal self a chance to live.  _I’d much rather know, but then again, not-knowing keeps all the possibilities open. It keeps all the worlds alive._ [Source](https://reading.supply/@jessica/some-comfort-for-the-time-being-64k4Ml)

> "This individual has merely acquired stamps of approval and has acquired safety net upon safety net. These safety nets don’t end up enabling big risk-taking—individuals just become habitual acquirers of safety nets. The comfort of a high-paying job at a prestigious firm surrounded by smart people is simply too much to give up. When that happens, the dreams that those options were meant to enable slowly recede into the background. For a few, those destinations are in fact their dreams come true—but for every one of those, there are ten entrepreneurs, artists, and restaurateurs that get trapped in those institutions." -- [Mihir Desai on Optionality](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/)

As humans, we tend to love 'exploring' our possibilities more than 'exploiting' and diving deep/committing to what we already have -- we lean heavily toward explore in the [exploit-explore](thoughts/exploit-explore.md) tradeoff curve.

This is the [optionality fallacy](https://nesslabs.com/optionality-fallacy).

In a life like the one we live in where cause and consequence is extremely hard to distinguish due to the huge number of confounding variables, trial and error reigns supreme. Though, this doesn't mean trying everything really quickly and abandoning things if results don't manifest (ahem, talented kid burnout syndrome)

> Tinkering and experimenting is a more efficient investment of your time than following a set path of learning which assumes an intrinsic value in specific skills and ignores the non-linear way life works.

 ## Prestige

 Is this why so many people want to join 'prestigious' places to work like big tech or consulting? To keep doors open?
 
 For lack of a better explanation, a big part of it feels like the go-to cop-out for individuals *unsure* of their larger life direction. Or maybe just lacking general conviction/self-confidence in themselves.
 
 Prestige, as Paul Graham defines it, is just fossilized inspiration. It's what was once new and successful and thus *became* prestigious. "If you do anything well enough, you'll _make_ it prestigious."
 
 A lot of people mistake prestige for excellence. The assumption is that prestige entails excellence but the reality is the opposite: prestige **follows** excellence
 
 ### Ivy League
"For the majority of Ivy Leaguers, the most impressive thing they've accomplished is achieving admission to their university. When you're deemed successful because you went to Harvard rather than celebrated for what got you there in the first place, you learn to game the system and just focus on the credentials the next time around."

This 'credentials' grind within these prestigious institutions is very reminiscient of [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md). They saw that their process of scrambling and playing 'the game' for college admissions got them prestige so they continue to optimize for that rather than success.
