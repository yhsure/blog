Creating a browsable store of knowledge that provides something useful at all distance scales (e.g. viewing the entire library, just a subcategory, a single file, etc.)

For example, dictionaries cut [indentations](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/thumb+index) into the pages to help you find the neighborhood of your entry then let you flip along glancing at guide words to finish your search.

Can we create [skimmable views on data](https://twitter.com/kirkbyo_/status/1475523898238197771)? Perhaps a spatially-anchored overview of the different 'branches' of knowledge

*Hyperscope is a browsing tool that enables most of the viewing and navigating features called for in Doug Engelbart's open hyperdocument system framework ([OHS](https://www.dougengelbart.org/about/ohs.html)) to support dynamic knowledge repositories*
