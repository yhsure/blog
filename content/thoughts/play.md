Play: the intentional activity of doing the thing you would want to do.

"Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot. Have as much fun as possible along the way. Turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints. Welcome everyone."

In a world were we seem to be locked behind these little rectangles, how can we escape? Embedded computing experiments like DynamicLand by Bret Victor (more in [interaction design](thoughts/interaction%20design.md))

## Creating spaces not products
"Creating a space for change does not necessarily mean you're doing it yourself; you're just making it possible for others." (a lot of similar ideas in [Design Justice](thoughts/Design%20Justice.md) and [a new DARPA](thoughts/new%20DARPA.md))

## Shifting the nature of work/education
Can we shift education system away from just assessing students to letting them explore the magical worlds themselves? A more [Mindstorms](thoughts/Mindstorms.md)-esque [constructionist](thoughts/constructionist.md) view on education.

## Magic Circles
[Source](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/magic-circles)

A “magic circle” is the space in which a game takes place. When we step into the magic circle, the we suspend the rules of ordinary life, and allow the rules of the game to mediate our interactions.

We often mark the boundaries of a magic circle through ceremonies:
-   Playing the [THX deep note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYMpMcmpfkI) before a movie
-   Singing the national anthem before a game
-   Ringing a gong before yoga practice
-   Walking down the aisle at a wedding

A lot of concepts similar to [The Grasshopper](thoughts/The%20Grasshopper.md), the lusory attitude as a [boundary](thoughts/boundary%20object.md)
