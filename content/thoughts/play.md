> In an empire of lies, telling the truth is a revolutionary act. In a fearful society; love and trust are the primary tools of resistance.

"Play allows us to create and share ownership of spaces in ways which competition cannot. Have as much fun as possible along the way. Turn life into a canvas, rather than a graph with checkpoints. Welcome everyone."

In a world were we seem to be locked behind these little rectangles, how can we escape? Embedded computing experiments like DynamicLand by Bret Victor (more in [beyond-touch](thoughts/beyond-touch.md))

## Creating spaces not products
"Creating a space for change does not necessarily mean you're doing it yourself; you're just making it possible for others." (a lot of similar ideas in [Design Justice](thoughts/books/design-justice.md) and [a new DARPA](thoughts/a-new-darpa.md))

## Shifting the nature of work/education
Can we shift education system away from just assessing students to letting them explore the magical worlds themselves? A more [Mindstorms](thoughts/books/mindstorms.md)-esque constructionist view on education.
