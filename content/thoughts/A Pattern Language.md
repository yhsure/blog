> “every individual in such a society will have a unique language, shared in part, but which as a totality is unique to the mind of the person who has it. In this sense, in a healthy society there will be as many pattern languages as there are people—even though these languages are shared and similar.”

Contains hundreds of patterns aimed at encapsulating a community-centric, bottom-up philosophy of [[thoughts/urban planning]], architecture, and collective livability

## Pattern
[a] pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice

Pattern languages are [[thoughts/composable|composable]], structured without being prescriptive, and for the purpose of practical design. Each pattern is connected to certain “larger” patterns which come above it in the language; and to certain “smaller” patterns which come below it in the language. The pattern helps to complete those larger patterns which are “above” it, and is itself completed by those smaller patterns which are “below” it.”
