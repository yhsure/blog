### Frank Jackson's Knowledge Argument
- Mary is confined to a black-and-white room, is educated through black-and-white books and through lectures relayed on black-and-white TV. Through this, she learns everything there is to know about the physical nature of the world, including all there is to know about the causal and relational facts consequent upon all this, including of course functional roles.
- If physicalism is true, she knows all there is to know.
- Yet, if Mary is let out of her black-and-white room or given a colour TV, she will learn what it is like to see something red.

The implication here is that Mary cannot learn what it is like to subjectively experience red from reading physical facts (similar argument re: [semantics](thoughts/semantics.md) in [Chinese room argument](thoughts/Chinese%20room%20argument.md)).

### Dennett's Refutation of the Knowledge Argument

> “And so, one day, Mary’s captors decided it was time for her to see colours. As a trick, they prepared a bright blue banana to present as her first colour experience ever. Mary took one look at it and said ‘Hey! You tried to trick me! Bananas are yellow but this one is blue!’ Her captors were dumbfounded. How did she do it? ‘Simple,’ she replied. ‘You have to remember that I know everything—absolutely everything— that could ever be known about the physical causes and effects of colour vision.

- No double transduction
	- Transduction is a conversion of one for another
	- Peripheral/internal transducers are sense organs (e.g. eyes) that transform physically detectable properties to electrochemical signals
	- There is no further conversion of neural signals into a qualitative medium
- No Cartesian theatre in the brain
	- There is no central place where all things 'come together' and [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) happens
	- Point of view of the observer is smeared over a large volumen of the brain with different networks (distributed model of representation)
- Consciousness is like fame
	- “Just as becoming famous is not a precisely datable event like being transduced into a medium (like being televised), so achieving consciousness in the brain is not a precisely datable transition in the brain.
- No qualia if intrinsic properties are *instantiated by* rather than *represented by* neural activity

## Essay
> Critically evaluate Frank Jackson’s “Knowledge Argument.” Does Mary learn something new, and if so, what exactly does she learn and what are the implications for physicalism? If she does not learn anything new, explain how and why this is the case.

1. exposition, what is the knowledge argument
	1. Experiencing colour still teachers Mary something new. Then, mental states, like colour perception, can't be completely described by physical facts
	2. Non-physical properties and knowledge which can only be discovered through conscious experiment
	3. Contradicts the theory of physicalism -> everything, including mental states, has a physical explanation
	4. Extending this, we could know every physical detail about someone else's brain and still not understand what it is like to experience things for them (qualia)
2. important to answer the question of whether

conceivability of the knowledge that mary can gain is doubtful

seeing (and phenomenal concepts as a whole) is tacit knowledge
- non-transferrable knowledge
- seeing is such tacit knowledge that cannot possibly be known through reading a book or experiments
- only acquired through practical experience in the relevant context

language is our only means of relaying this knowledge
only constructs potemkin villages of experience

knowledge != fact
experiencing != learning



talk of ‘physical information’ in the context of the knowledge argument is ambiguous between an epistemological and an ontological reading

is learned experience say anything about mental states
ways of knowing that only involve learning through words
