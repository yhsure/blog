Forming a belief based on the [trust](thoughts/trust.md) of another's written or spoken word.

Three main positions of validity of knowledge gained through testimony
1. Skepticism (e.g. John Locke): one cannot gain knowledge on the basis of testimony alone. Cannot ensure reliability of other actors
2. [Reductionism](thoughts/Reductionism.md): one can gain knowledge through testimony, but only if one has independent, inductive reason for believing that the speaker is reliable
3. Non-reductionism (e.g. [Nyāya](thoughts/Nyāya.md)): one can gain knowledge through testimony simply by trusting the speaker (provided that the speaker knows what they assert). Testimony is a trust-worthy [epistemic](thoughts/epistemology.md) instrument, knowledge is communal

## Experts: Which Ones Should You Trust?
*by Alvin I. Goldman (2001)*

Central Question: the Novice/2-Expert Problem
- An expert
	- Knows a lot about the domain (first order material)
	- Knows about the literature concerning the domain (second order material)
	- Able to draw on this knowledge to produce answers about the domain
- Two experts disagree, as a novice, which expert do you trust as more credible? 5 kinds of evidence
	1. Arguments presented by the contending to support their own views and critique their rival's views
	2. Agreement from additional putative experts on one side or other of the subject in question
		1. Counterpoint: Copernican heliocentrism, most 'experts' believed that the Earth was the middle of the solar system, not the sun
		2. Goldman steel-mans his argument through Bayesian analysis, experts should think for themselves and should be 'conditionally independent' -- they will not invariably parrot the claims of others when those claims are wrong
		3. What about discoverability of experts? If a tree falls but nobody hears it, did it still happen?
	3. Appraisals by "meta-experts" of the experts' expertise
	4. Evidence of the expert's interests and biases vis-a-vis the question at issue
	5. Evidence of the expert's past track-records
- Important to note that all of these depend on *human* knowledge, not [religious authority](thoughts/religious%20authority.md)
- Not fool-proof either, e.g. differences in communication medium, language, smooth-talking, etc.
- How does the novice avoid cognitive [biases](thoughts/bias.md) of their own?
