1. Skepticism (e.g. John Locke): one cannot gain knowledge on the basis of testimony alone. Cannot ensure reliability of other actors
2. [Reductionism](thoughts/Reductionism.md): one can gain knowledge through testimony, but only if one has independent, inductive reason for believing that the speaker is reliable
