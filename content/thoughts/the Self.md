1. Me (self-as-object)
	1. Some feature is the object of my awareness
	2. I recognize this feature as mine or ascribe it to myself
2. I (self-as-subject)
	1. I experience myself as subject of perception/cognition/emotion
	2. Body anchored

Valid in dreams, but also [games](thoughts/games.md)?

Autoscopic Phenomena
- Autoscopic Hallucination: you see a double of yourself but do not feel like you have ownership or agnecy over it
- Heautoscopy: visual perspective switches back and forth between yourself and double and you feel ownership of both
- Out-of-body experience: you identify the body seen from the outside as yours but have no feeling of agency for it
	- Direct electrical stimulation at the temporoparietal junction induces out-of-body experiences

## Views of the self
1. Neuro-nihilism
	- There is no self
	- The self is an illusion created by the brain
	- "I" does not refer to anything so all references are errors (false)
2. Enactive View
	- The self is a process
	- Enacted through social cognition and language, rooted in the life of the body immersed in the environment
	- "I" functions performatively, not referentially
	- I-making (ahamkāra): the sense of being an "I" who endures through tiem and who is a thinker of thoughts and a doer of deeds
		- dancing is a process that enacts a dance in the dance itself is no different from dancing
		- similarly, the self is a process that enacts an "I" and the "I" is no different from the self
		- The self is self-specifying ([autopoietic](thoughts/autopoiesis.md)) and also [interdependent](thoughts/interdependence.md) (dependently originated process)
3. Absolutism
	- There exists a real independent self

## Identity
Essay by Jenny Odell and in [Kopi Chats on Substack](https://kopiclub.substack.com/p/letter-37-loneliness-vs-being-alone)

> _“When I examine my identity, I do see an inalienable spirit grasping for infinity. But in the very same place, I also see an intersection of historical and cultural vectors, held up by **a web of countless reliances**.”_

Reminds me of Indra's Net, that everything is [interdependent](thoughts/interdependence.md), [empty](thoughts/emptiness.md) of dependent origination.

"Connective vulnerability is so frightening because sometimes we will be let down by others, unmoored from [friendships](thoughts/friendship.md) and relationships we thought were our anchors in life. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. (see: [nothing stops](posts/nothing%20stops.md))"
