In essence, a simple collection which can be thought of as a graph. Three components

1. A collection of objects (nodes)
2. A collection of morphisms (edges).
   - If $f$ is a morphism with source C and target B, we write $f: C \rightarrow B$
3. A notion of composition of morphisms.
   - If we have $g: A \rightarrow B$ and $f: B \rightarrow C$, they can be composed resulting in a morphism $f \circ g: A \rightarrow C$
   - Composition of morphisms needs to be associative. Typically applied right to left
