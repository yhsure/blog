A form of arithmetical utilitarianism (see: [effective altruism](thoughts/effective%20altruism.md)), assuming that one can meaningfully calculate the utility of actions as a numerical value.

You could then "shut up and multiply" utterly negligible probabilities by hypothetical huge outcomes, and take the resulting number seriously — there exists scenarios in which you should torture one person for 50 years if it would prevent dust specks in the eyes of a sufficiently large number of people — resulting in claims like eight lives being saved per dollar donated (a claim made using a calculation of this sort, very popular arguments in EA circles).
