## Heidegger
Concept of dasein, which literally means 'Being-there'. Through the use of this expression, Heidegger calls to attention the fact that a human cannot exist or be taken into account without existing in [context](thoughts/context.md) of a world with other things -- "to be human is to be fixed, embedded, and immersed in the physical, literal, tangible day to day world"
