> Ways of being

The nature of being and structures of objects. Ontology seeks the classification and explanation of things. A branch of [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]].

## Heidegger
Concept of dasein, which literally means 'Being-there'. Through the use of this expression, Heidegger calls to attention the fact that a human cannot exist or be taken into account without existing in [context](thoughts/context.md) of a world with other things -- "to be human is to be fixed, embedded, and immersed in the physical, literal, tangible day to day world"

## Technology
Technology as it relates to ontology.
-   technology is not just neutral: [[thoughts/Do Artifacts Have Politics|artifacts have politics]]
-   artifacts shape and create ways of being
-   "design is ontological"
	-   civic design + [[thoughts/urban planning|urban planning]] are also importantly ontological
	-   designing spaces of dwelling + being

The train changed the way we exist -- it expands the vista of existence. We are betting on new means of technology for new ways of being, ones attuned to interdependence, mutuality, etc. Emphasizing the ontology of interdependence over the ontology of separation.
