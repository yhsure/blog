> Ways of being

The nature of being and structures of objects. Ontology seeks the classification and explanation of things. A branch of [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]].

## Heidegger
Concept of dasein, which literally means 'Being-there'. Through the use of this expression, Heidegger calls to attention the fact that a human cannot exist or be taken into account without existing in [context](thoughts/context.md) of a world with other things -- "to be human is to be fixed, embedded, and immersed in the physical, literal, tangible day to day world"

### Near-ness
- Heidegger observes that because of technology, “all distances in time and space are shrinking” and “yet the hasty setting aside of all distances brings no nearness; for nearness does not consist in a small amount of distance.”

### Essence
- The essence of technology is not something we make; it is a mode of being, or of revealing. ... To consider technology essentially is to see it as an event to which we belong: the structuring, ordering, and “requisitioning” of everything around us, and of ourselves.

## Technology
Technology as it relates to ontology.
- technology is not just neutral: [[thoughts/Do Artifacts Have Politics|artifacts have politics]]
- artifacts shape and create ways of being
- "design is ontological"
	- civic design + [[thoughts/urban planning|urban planning]] are also importantly ontological
	- designing spaces of dwelling + being

The train changed the way we exist -- it expands the vista of existence. We are betting on new means of technology for new ways of being, ones attuned to interdependence, mutuality, etc. Emphasizing the ontology of interdependence over the ontology of separation.

My understanding of Heidegger on technology is that it is about a _reorganization_ of the world, both spatially and temporally. It is this same reorganization or framing that “orders” all things we know (e.g. point 2) — see modern theories of God and consciousness referring to [[thoughts/Primary of Consciousness#The Blind Spot|quantum microtubules]] to try to explain them. Technology then, is a way of ‘challenging’ existing means of knowledge in a way that reframes it.

Heidegger sees technology as potentially dangerous in that it instrumentalizes the human and the subjective and “displaces” things from their unmediated existence.
