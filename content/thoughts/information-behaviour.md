A combination of [information retrieval](thoughts/information-retrieval.md), information encountering, information avoidance, etc.

A model is a simplified, tentative representation of a phenomenon of interest, often depicted as a graphic. A model describes important factors (variables) and proposes their relationships (associations).

## Information Seeking Behaviour
### Dervin's Sense-making Model
![](/thoughts/images/dervin.png)

Knowledge 'is the sense made at a particular point in time-space by someone'

Information seeking is conceptualized as a gap-bridging process in which the individual makes moves, influenced by information, in time and space to reach a desired outcome or goal to make sense of a ever-gappy 'reality'

In this model, an information object is not seen simply as an entity that meets or is relevant to an information need. Rather, information embedded in an information object must be conceptualized by the individual in a particular situation in order to influence actions.

### Wilson's Information-seeking Model

Perceived information need is bounded in a context (column 1). This perceived need may not be enough if there isn't enough to activate actions if the stress isn't high enough (column 2). Intervening variables may become either barriers to or in support of information seeking activities (column 3). The actual activation mechanism itself is driven by social learning theory.

### Bystrom and Jarvelin's Model
Model to frame information need and seeking in the context of professional work. Work tasks are either assigned to, or identified by, workers.

Similar to Wilson's Feedback loop
1. Perceived information need

### Ellis's Behavioural Model
![](/thoughts/images/ellis.png)

Grounded theory approach, built a descriptive model based on empirical studies of social and natural scientists, humanities scholars, industrial engineers and research scientists.

8 main types of information activities
1. Starting: initial info-gathering (e.g. searching or asking colleagues)
2. Chaining: going down the rabbit-holes found in Starting
3. Browsing: casual search for info in different sources (generally non-intentional)
4. Differentiating: rough grouping and separating of different identities/origin of sources
5. Monitoring: keeping updated with developments
6. Extracting: finding relevant materials in source
7. Verifying: making sure info is correct
8. Ending: final search

There is no sequential pattern of seeking activities (except that verifying is the penultimate step in the whole process)

## 11 Deadliest Sins of Knowledge Management
Fahey and Prusak (1998)

1. Not developing a working definition of knowledge.
2. Emphasizing knowledge stock to the detriment of knowledge flow.
3. Viewing knowledge as existing predominantly outside the heads of individuals.
4. Not understanding that a fundamental intermediate purpose of managing knowledge is to create shared context.
5. Paying little heed to the role and importance of tacit knowledge.
6. Disentangling knowledge from its uses.
7. Downplaying thinking and reasoning.
8. Focussing on the past and the present and not the future.
9. Failing to recognize the importance of experimentation.
10. Substituting technical contact for human interface.
11. Seeking to develop direct measures of knowledge.

## Information Foraging
Developed at XEROX PARC in the late 1990s and was inspired by biomimicry (specifically, animal behaviour theories) 

||Animal Foraging|Information Foraging|
|---|---|---|
|Goal|Food|Information|
|Patch|Site containing one or more potential sources for food|A source of information (e.g. website)|
|Forage|Search for food|Search for information|
|Scent|How likely a patch will provide food|How promising a source of information appear to user|
|Diet|Totality of food types that can satisfy hunger for an animal|Totality of information sources that a user may consider useful|

**Rate of gain = Information value / Cost associated with obtaining that information (both actual time/effort and opportunity cost)**

[Bounded rationality is at play here](thoughts/rationality.md)

Obviously we don't have perfect estimation for 1) how much information a patch contains and 2) how much time it will take to extract that information. This is where info scent comes in.

Things that contribute to scent:
1. Perceived credibility
2. Information density
3. Length

### Enrichment
Techniques, tools, and interactions, that maximize the itility of the information foraging. This can happen either between patches or within patches.

**But**, a good user experience involves web pages that are designed so that the user can get the maximum relevant information in the minimum amount of time.

Behaviour enrichments
- avoiding context switching ([page parking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/multi-tab-page-parking/): opening multiple pages in rapid-fire succession to save them for later)
- avoid reading the entire page but still getting the majority of information ([F-pattern scanning](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/))
- typically ignoring banners and the right rail

Interaction enrichments
- critically thinking about specific keywords for query
- use of within-page search (ctrl-f) to quickly locate content
