> Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept

The principle is also known as Postel's law, after Jon Postel, who used the wording in an early specification of TCP.

"It takes two to miscommunicate." A great listener, _or_ a skilled speaker, can resolve a lot of conflicts.

Postel's Law is the principle the [[thoughts/Internet]] is based on. Not because Jon Postel was such a great salesperson and talked everyone into it, but because that is the only winning evolutionary strategy when internets are competing.
