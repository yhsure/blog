Very utilitarian, approach that the suffering of a few is okay as long as the greater good benefits? rel: [The ones who walk from Omelas](thoughts/articles/the-ones-who-walk-from-omelas.md)

What about self-care? How does the self fit into the greater whole?

## What is EA?
Earning to give. How do we reduce the stigma around wealth?

Work can have huge impacts on the type of change we can make in the world. We spend ~80k hours, makes sense to spend atleast 1% of it thinking about what to dedicate the other 99% to.

How do we time donations to maximize impact? Turns out there's no 'goldilocks zone' in the continuum.
* When you're young: justify putting it off by saying "oh I'll donate when I have more money"
* When you're old: justify not doing it by saying "oh that's too much of my money I'm giving away"

## [Building in public](thoughts/building-in-public.md) as a form of EA

Working and being vocal about your work is a way to amplify your effective impact radius. By doing so, you can change other people's thinking around giving, money, and charity through discussion

## Shallow Puddle Analogy
Story from [source](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SwG8Tj9RkG8DzpM4f/the-drowning-child-and-the-expanding-circle)

One morning, you notice a child has fallen in and appears to be drowning. To wade in and pull the child out would be easy, but it will mean that you get your clothes wet and muddy, and by the time you go home and change you will have missed your first class.

Do you have any obligation to rescue the child? Unanimously, most people say they do. Does it matter if other people walk by the pond and do nothing? Most people still say no. Does it matter if the child were far away, in another country perhaps? Most people still say no.

"We are all in that situation of the person passing the shallow pond. We can all save the lives of people, both children and adults, who would otherwise die, and we can do so at a very small cost to us: the cost of a new CD, a shirt, or a night out at a restaurant or concert, can mean the difference between life and death to more than one person somewhere in the world."
