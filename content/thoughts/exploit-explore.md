"The ideal is to find an equilibrium point between external pulls and internal pushes, between exploitation (of your current opportunities via external pulls) and exploration (of your actual passions via internal pushes)... the process of finding equilibrium often takes the form of a damped oscillation over time"

how much of this is just [feedback loops](/thoughts/feedback-loops) but for learning/interests?

telic and paratelic [goals](posts/2020.md) -> means to and end or the end itself?

can we encourage play again and reclaim it from this coopted hacker culture where work is play? re: [hackathons](posts/hackathons.md)

## Regret Minimization Framework
[Source (funny that it's Bezos)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ)

Project yourself to age 80 and look back on your life. How do I minimize the regrets that I have? Will you regret abondoning this idea?

Is a life well-lived one that is fully maximized? What if I just want to live for vibes (which are inherently unoptimizable)?
