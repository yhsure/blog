> The more accessible a good is, the less people want to pay for it. --[Scott Moore](https://scott.mirror.xyz/7nKKV4x17rVkZL9_C0vVL3Vax2rv1H1ciigleEgBAOw?utm_source=pocket_mylist)

A government only has interest in [funding](thoughts/funding.md) its own roads, companies like Facebook only have interest in funding their own infrastructure. Very prevalent in [open-source](posts/paid-open-source.md), some of the most used software in the world often goes unpaid and unfunded.

Commons in the modern economic context is any open-access and unregulated resource (e.g. atmosphere, ocean, rivers, etc.)

> How we might focus less on speculation and more on participation?

Does this impact [digital commons](thoughts/digital%20commons.md) too? What about for [climate tech](thoughts/climate%20tech.md)?

Would be solved if people acted according Kant's Categorical Imperative (tldr; only act in a certain way if it is possible and desirable for everyone in the world to act in that way)
