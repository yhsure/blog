> **Solid** is a [specification](https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol) that lets people store their data securely in decentralized data stores called **Pods**. Pods are like secure personal web servers for data. When data is stored in someone's Pod, they control which people and applications can access it.

## Pods
- Pods are like secure personal web servers for your data.
- You can get a Pod from a Pod Provider, or you may choose to self-host your Pod.
- Users can own multiple pods
- Linked Data means that different applications can work with the same data
