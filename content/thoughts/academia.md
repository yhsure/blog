## Tunnel Vision
https://www.briantimar.com/notes/mimetic/mimetic/
Graduate programs select for intensely competitive individuals with highly specific skills, often with negligible market value outside of universities. A strong desire for publications on esoteric topics is inherited from senior postdocs and professors, making tunnel vision especially acute.

## Incentive Structure
Academia feels more pure, more like play? More of a 'constructionist' approach, freedom to ask your own questions rel: [mindstorms](/thoughts/books/mindstorms)

Thinking about how similar the incentive structures are in [hackathons](/posts/hackathons)

Can we create the energy of DARPA outside of government [funding](thoughts/funding.md)? A modern day Xerox Parc or Bell Labs? A [new DARPA](thoughts/a-new-darpa.md) perhaps?

## MS Research
Session w/ Jim Pinkelman, Ph.D. Been at MS for 19 years, 11 years in Microsoft Research

Most of MS research is not necessarily driven by a technical challenge that a product group faces. Very driven by research interests of new hires.

Missions
1. Advance the state-of-the-art in CS
2. Rapidly transfer technologies to Microsoft products and services
3. Incubate disruptive technologies and new business

95% of internal research is peer-reviewed + published

1990 memo
* "We have some unique potential to productize research"
* "We should still listen to external research, but in some areas there is a big benefit in owning the tech"

Horizons
* Horizon 1: Near term, ~6mo-1yr, what technical challenges do we need to overcome?
* Horizon 2: Medium term, 1-4yrs, idea of general challenge needed to be solved
* Horizon 3: Long term, 5-10yrs, advancement in the field

MSR sub-groups
1. MSR Labs: Long term basic research
2. MSR NExT: New experiences and technologies
