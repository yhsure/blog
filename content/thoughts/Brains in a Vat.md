## Brain in a Vat
- [Putnam's Ant Argument](thoughts/Putnam's%20Ant%20Argument.md): does intentionality matter for representation?
- Related to [virtual worlds](thoughts/virtual%20worlds.md) and the Matrix
-   we all live in a "collective hallucination", i believe you exist and i can tell you think and hear things
-   could we say/think/believe that we are brains in a vat?
-   putnam states that this argument is false as it is self-refuting
	1.  Assume we are brains in a vat
	2.  If we are brains in a vat, then “brain” does not refer to brain, and “vat” does not refer to vat (via CC)
	3.  If “brain in a vat” does not refer to brains in a vat, then “we are brains in a vat” is false
	4.  Thus, if we are brains in a vat, then the sentence “We are brains in a vat” is false (1,2,3)
-   are the things that BIVs refer to the same things that we as real people refer to?
