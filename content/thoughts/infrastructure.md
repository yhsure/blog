## What is infrastructure even?
-   things that use infrastructure or infrastructure
    -   in the beginning not much of a distinction
    -   first tech â†’ language
        -   how did language arise?
        -   evolve with each other?
        -   language as infrastructure for thought
    -   at a certain complexity level, combinatorial explosion of complexity
    -   does it grows as emergent behaviour?
-   is any infrastructure ever new?
    -   is everything derivative?
    -   is thought ever new? or is it recombinatorial
        -   feral children???
        -   neuroplasticity of culture and language?
- do we need to define [infrastructure](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-09/the-meaning-of-infrastructure-is-a-pointless-debate)?
