## What is infrastructure even?
-   things that use infrastructure or infrastructure
    -   in the beginning not much of a distinction
    -   first tech → language
        -   how did language arise?
        -   evolve with each other?
        -   language as infrastructure for thought
    -   at a certain complexity level, combinatorial explosion of complexity
    -   does it grows as emergent behaviour?
-   is any infrastructure ever new?
    -   is [everything derivative?](thoughts/originality.md)
    -   is thought ever new? or is it recombinatorial
        -   feral children???
        -   neuroplasticity of culture and language?
- do we need to define [infrastructure](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-04-09/the-meaning-of-infrastructure-is-a-pointless-debate)?

> Thus, infrastructure design requires a more subtle approach: **creating the right incentives, environments, and dependencies to encourage well-being while preserving user autonomy**.

Infrastructure can be [emergent](/thoughts/emergent-behaviour)

"I have admiringly called this the "Procrastination Principle," wherein an elegant network design would not be unduly complicated by attempts to solve every possible problem that one could imagine materializing in the future. We see the [principle at work](http://yupnet.org/zittrain/2008/03/01/chapter-6-the-lessons-of-wikipedia/#27) in Wikipedia, where the initial pitch for it would seem preposterous: 'We can generate a consummately thorough and mostly reliable encyclopedia by allowing anyone in the world to create a new page and anyone else in the world to drop by and revise it.'"

## Moderation

"So the internet was a recipe for mortar, with an invitation for anyone, and everyone, to bring their own bricks."

This absence of central control, or even easy central monitoring, has long been celebrated as an instrument of grassroots democracy and freedom. -> did this arise out of the [counterculture](thoughts/books/fctc.md)?

Gap of responsibility: Their designs naturally create gaps of responsibility for maintaining valuable content that others rely on.

"It’s not trivial to censor a network as organic and decentralized as the internet. But more recently, these features have been understood to facilitate vectors for individual harassment and societal destabilization, with no easy gating points through which to remove or label malicious work not under the umbrellas of the major social-media platforms, or to quickly identify their sources."

"10 years ago, a third-party bookseller offered a well-known book in Kindle format on Amazon for 99 cents a copy, mistakenly thinking it was no longer under copyright. Once the error was noted, Amazon—in something of a panic—reached into every Kindle that had downloaded the book and deleted it. The book was, fittingly enough, George Orwell’s _1984_. (_You don’t have 1984. In fact, you never had 1984. There is no such book as 1984._)"

"Indeed, Wikipedia suffers from vandalism, and over time, its sustaining community has developed tools and practices for dealing with it that didn’t exist when Wikipedia was created. If they’d been implemented too soon, the extra hurdles to starting and editing pages might have deterred many of the contributions that got Wikipedia going to begin with."

Curious about how this relates to [ephemereal content](/thoughts/ephemereal-content)

Is moderation and managing rot there a form of [maintenance](/thoughts/creation-vs-maintenance)?

## Censorship
How do we draw the line between an end product and infrastructure? How should infrastructure regulate usage on its platform (if at all)? Been thinking about AWS's decision to remove Parler recently and whether it was warranted for AWS to do so. At what level of infrastructure should something become a '[public good](thoughts/public-goods.md)'? As more and more of our digital infrastructure is built out under private companies, does it change how we govern content on top of it?

The benefit of retroactive correction in some instances—imagine fixing a typographical error in the proportions of a recipe, or blocking out someone’s phone number shared for the purposes of harassment—should be contextualized against the prospect of systemic, chronic demands for revisions by aggrieved people or companies single-mindedly demanding changes that serve to eat away at the public record.
