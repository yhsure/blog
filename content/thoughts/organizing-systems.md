_Organizing System_: an [intentionally](thoughts/intentional-arrangement.md) arranged collection of resources and the interactions they support. It has authoritative description and standard classification. 

We organize
- physical things (objects/artefacts)
- information about physical things
- digital things
- information about digital things (metadata)

The document as an 'information container', but also a 'thing' which documents a thing. Data can be seen as 'elementary observations about properties of objects, events, and their environments'

There are inherent tradeoffs in an organizing system, what is the goal? What are we optimizing for?

### Three Tiers of Organizing Systems
1. User interface or presentation components where users or other applications interact with the data
2. Business logic or functions that use the data
3. Storage of data itself

### Design Heuristics
Sensemaking: organizing to derive meaning from experience by fitting new events of observations into what they already know

General organizing principles
1. We organize collections of resources using the properties that are easiest to perceive, or whose values vary the most among the items in the collection
2. We group together resources that we often use together
3. We put rare or unique resources where we can protect them

Examples of these are 1. alphabetical ordering or 2. chronological ordering
