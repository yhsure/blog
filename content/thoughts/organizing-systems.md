_Organizing System_: an intentionally arranged collection of resources and the interactions they support

We organize
- physical things (objects/artefacts)
- information about physical things
- digital things
- information about digital things (metadata)

The document as an 'information container', but also a 'thing' which documents a thing. Data can be seen as 'elementary observations about properties of objects, events, and their environments'

There are inherent tradeoffs in an organizing system, what is the goal? What are we optimizing for?
