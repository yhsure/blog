Can we use [[thoughts/language|language]] as the method of querying memory? 

## Language of thought hypothesis
- proposes thinking occurs in a mental language, this is called mentalese
    -   computations in a classical way
    -   classical computational architecture distinguishes between data-structures and rules/programs which operate on said structures
-  [[thoughts/neural networks|neural networks]] or [connectionist networks](thoughts/connectionist%20networks.md) challenges any argument for mentalese (as they don't fall under the [[thoughts/GOFAI|GOFAI]]/classical computation category)
