Characteristics
* Truthfulness: information is correct
* Aboutness: tells us about something else
* Thingness: information is a thing, although perhaps intangible

The study of information in and of itself is a research area too, through [education and epistemology](toc/education-and-epistemology.md)

### w.r.t. Power

As information becomes more abundant and saturated in our world, has information been any more of less important/necessary? We may have access to more of it, but it’s not obvious that this is better—just different.

> While technology has changed the volume, pace, and sources of information in our daily lives, it has not changed its essential power to shape our knowledge and our behavior in the world.

Information fuels discovery. It enables us to build off of each others work, and accomplish more than what a [single person could](posts/collaborative-thinking.md).

Information organizes us. The models of thinking and computation (e.g. numbering system) affect how we think about the world writ large and forms the basis for the computational systems which we interact with daily.

Information regulates us. The law, in its codified and written forms, encodes great injustices and inequities through dictating what rights are and who gets them.

Information identifies us. Each of us leave informational foot prints as we live our lives through documents, interactions, and conversations.


Contrary to Marshall McLuhan’s famous phrase, "the medium is the message", it seems as if the vast majority of the power from information is derived from its meaning and context rather than its medium or method of transmission.
