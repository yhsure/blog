> A commitment is both the promise and the following action.

- "Chemistry only happens on contact. You couldn't have known that you'd learn to love the squeaky floorboards, nor could you have known that you'd keep jamming your toe into the kitchen counter. There are a million things I could've done, a thousand things I could've realised earlier, but the only way I could've known it wouldn't work was to go through it."
