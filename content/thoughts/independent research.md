- In independent research, one often pendulums between two brains that drive your day-to-day
	1. Brain 1: I want to make change in the world, I want to ship and build
		- This is the beginners mind, it helps you escape the conceptual walls of today's dogma.
		- Kuhn pointed out, the biggest ideas [transcend the existing paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift) and create their own lane.
	2. Brain 2: I want to *understand* why this works the way it does
		- It is almost always Brain 2 thinking that leads to incredibly high payoffs in clarity and increased conviction.
- Don't have conviction that you are right because that will lead to disappointment. Have conviction that you will learn regardless. It is sufficient to do things to learn and to understand (even if just about yourself)
	- This comes with a certain level of [[thoughts/self-confidence|self-confidence]] and/or [[posts/the-fools-who-dream|foolishness]]
	- “Who am I to even try to solve this problem, when so many people smarter than me have tried and failed in the past?”
		- The people who succeeded had a healthy smidge of arrogance: a belief, perhaps irrational, that while they were not _guaranteed_ to succeed, they had a fair shot.
		- If they also had the thought, would they have even tried their hand at the problem?
- Often times, it is one core principle that if followed to its natural conclusion/end will result in a fundamental perspective shift (e.g. quantum mechanics).
	- What is that core principle that sits at the heart of everything you find interesting? The connection between the dots is only evident in hindsight so don't spend too long thinking about it. But just follow your gut, it right more often than not.
- On feedback and doing research in public. People often ask me if [[thoughts/building in public]] is actually worth doing.
	- I've found a nice middle ground where I'm public enough about my work where anyone interested can find it without too much trouble but not public or frequent enough that my only reward/validation cycle is likes on Twitter
	- Still, being somewhat public about your work is good on two dimensions
		1. Breaking things into legible pieces is important. If not for other people, for yourself to have small wins and to crystallize thought into something that is mostly self-contained
		2. You will expand the realm of what is possible for others. People will look at you and be like "wow, I didn't even know that was even an option"; *that* being whatever endeavour you are pursuing, whether that be independent research, film-making, or anything outside of the normal 9-5
	- [Kasra](https://bitsofwonder.substack.com/p/how-to-be-an-unsuccessful-thinker) puts this balance this very well in his piece on thinking but I think it applies to research more broadly as well: "When you have an idea, before you dump it onto the world, there is value in cultivating it, massaging it, rewriting it again and again ... Do this in silence, and _then_ bring it to others and get their thoughts."
- Communities and feeling lonely
	- I often say that independent research doesn't mean you have to do it alone. I think many people wait around to kind of bump into the right community people that are the perfect mix of genuine, kind, and curious.
	- I've found the best way to do that is to not only active seek these people out, but to create watering holes where these people gather
		- Vonnegut similarly thought that community building was incredibly important: “What should young people do with their lives today? Many things, obviously. But the most daring thing is to create stable communities in which the terrible disease of loneliness can be cured.”
- Don't get trapped in the mindset of having every little thing you do fit perfectly in your grand master plan. An effective hill-climber is one that sometimes goes in the wrong-direction! (see also: [[thoughts/exploit explore]])
