## Social Bias in Information Retrieval

"Many algorithmic processes are opaque and that the reasons for this may vary. For instance, it is more often than not difficult to interpret results from models induced by new machine learning techniques such as deep learning" (especially why we need to work on [explainability](thoughts/explainability.md))

As a counter argument, there are social and economic challenges for achieving algorithmic transparency, such as the need for developers/owners of such processes to protect trade secrets, or even the privacy concerns of users.

Friedman and Nissenbaum's definition of bias:
1. its results are slanted in unfair discrimination against particular persons or groups
2. the observed discrimination is systematic within the system

> Indeed, over the past years, many researchers have found that search engines, through the result sets they present to users, tend to reinforce a view of the social world that aligns with the status quo.

## Algorithms of Oppression (Chapter 1)
Moving the focus away from 'problematic users and data' to search architecture itself.

> If the majority rules in search engine results, then how might those who are in the minority ever be able to influence or control the way they are represented in a search engine?

These search results influence the values that surround what is being searched for. This means that minority groups often have their own values and identities influenced by the majority: [double-consciousness](thoughts/collections.md)

Why have we become so reliant on search? Is it a part of our [extended mind](thoughts/extended-mind.md)?

> [Search](thoughts/search.md) is a symbiotic process that both informs and is informed in part by users.  

"Google directs web traffic to mainstream corporate news conglomerates, which increases their ability to shape the political discourse." This is the [zero-sum](thoughts/zero-sum.md) [attention economy](thoughts/attention-economy.md).

> Decreases in funding for public information institutions such as libraries and educational institutions and shifts of responsibility to individuals and the private sector have reframed the ways that the public conceives of what can and should be in the public domain.  

### Search Engines as Faith
They freely provide, it seems, a sorting of the wheat from the chaff, and answer our most profound and most trivial questions. They have become an object of faith. Many view the results of search as objective.

"Like gods, these mathematical models were opaque, their workings invisible to all but the highest priests in their domain: mathematicians and computer scientists." (Cathy O'Neil)
