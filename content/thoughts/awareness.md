An inverse is absence, particularly visual absence

## On Having No Head
*D. E. Harding*

> What actually happened was something absurdly simple and  
unspectacular: just for the moment I stopped thinking.  
Reason and imagination and all mental chatter died down.  
For once, words really failed me. I forgot my name, my  
humanness, my thingness, all that could be called me or  
mine. Past and future dropped away. It was as if I had been  
born that instant, brand new, mindless, innocent of all  
memories. There existed only the Now, that present moment  
and what was clearly given in it. To look was enough.

> And what I found was khaki trouserlegs terminating  
downwards in a pair of brown shoes, khaki sleeves  
terminating sideways in a pair of pink hands, and a khaki  
shirtfront terminating upwards in - absolutely nothing  
whatever! Certainly not in a head...

First-person methods are central to the philosophical movement known as Phenomenology.
