On when to [trust](thoughts/trust.md) [epistemic](thoughts/epistemology.md) claims

Tools to evaluate authority
1. Epistemic Culture: what do members of the culture take to be valid sources of knowledge
2. Epistemic Self: an individual epistemic agent within a culture might have their own idiosyncratic belief about how the source work, how they're weighted, etc.

Even within a shared epistemic culture, how do we evaluate whose testimony is authoritative?

On whether critical thinking is good?
- Opponent: you should NOT engage in critical thinking with regard to expert testimony (because you don't have the knowledge to add anything)
- Anand's counter-argument: you always need to critically evaluate at least the following
	1. who are the authorities?
	2. are they currently properly performing their authority?
	3. what does their authority amount to, within their expertise?
- "Best bet view": if the weighted average of authorities who meet these tests say something, we should trust that it's true (this depends on epistemic culture and epistemic self)

Trusting the word of others is necessary to expand knowledge beyond perception, e.g. we will never know what it is like to be another person (see [Nagel's Bat Argument](thoughts/Nagel's%20Bat%20Argument.md))
