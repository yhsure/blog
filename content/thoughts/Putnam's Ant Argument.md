-   The ant who traces a line that ends up looking like a caricature of Winston Churchill. Is it a picture or representation of him?
-   resemblance is not necessary nor sufficient for representation
	-   not sufficient → A can resemble B even if it fails to represent B
	-   not necessary → A can represent B even if A fails to resemble B
-   do we need intention?
-   how do you have a thought _about_ something?
    -   the problem of intentionality
    -   "No physical object can, in itself, refer to one thing rather than to another; nevertheless, thoughts in the mind obviously do succeed in referring to one thing rather than another. So thoughts (and hence the mind) are of an essentially different nature than physical objects"
-   words and pictures aren't inherently _about_ something, that meaning is added via our own attitudes
    -   if so, what do our attitudes depend on?
-   what does matter for representation is some sort of causal link back to the [original thing](thoughts/originality.md)
    -   X caused Y to do Z
