Can we create associations between digital/physical space and concept space? Create a digital library of our concepts and ideas?

## Better ways to browse/discover ideas and concepts

More from Bret Victor and DynamicLand: http://worrydream.com/cdg/ResearchAgenda-v0.19-poster.pdf

Creating a browsable store of knowledge that provides something useful at all distance scales (e.g. viewing the entire library, just a subcategory, a single file, etc.)

Create a spatially-anchored overview of the different 'branches' of knowledge

Material is dynamic and multi-medium

Conceptual connections between pieces of knowledge and branches can be visually seen and explored

Can we bring together representations *across fields* so ideas can cross-pollinate?

2. Instantiation: going from abstraction to specific examples
3. Analogy: diverse examples of the same pattern
