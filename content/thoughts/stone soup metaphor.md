### Stone Soup Metaphor
[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup)

> Some travelers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the very hungry travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large [stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology) "Rock (geology)") in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travelers answer that they are making "stone [soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup "Soup")", which tastes wonderful and which they would be delighted to share with the villager, although it still needs a little bit of [garnish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garnish_(food) "Garnish (food)"), which they are missing, to improve the flavor.

> The villager, who anticipates enjoying a share of the soup, does not mind parting with a few [carrots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot "Carrot"), so these are added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travelers again mention their stone soup which has not yet reached its full potential. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient, like [potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potatoes "Potatoes"), [onions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onions "Onions"), [cabbages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbages "Cabbages"), [peas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peas "Peas"), [celery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celery "Celery"), [tomatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomatoes "Tomatoes"), [sweetcorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetcorn "Sweetcorn"), [meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat "Meat") (like [chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_(meat) "Chicken (meat)"), [pork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork "Pork") and [beef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef "Beef")), [milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk "Milk"), [butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter "Butter"), [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt "Salt") and [pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pepper "Black pepper"). Finally, the stone (being inedible) is removed from the pot, and a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by travelers and villagers alike. Although the travelers have thus tricked the villagers into sharing their food with them, they have successfully transformed it into a tasty meal which they share with the donors.
