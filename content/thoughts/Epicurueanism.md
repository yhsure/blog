Epicurus: Greek philosopher than founded Epicureanism

Aims to lead a life characterized by
1.  equanimity (*ataraxia*) and
2. the absence of pain (*aponia*)

The universe is infinite and eternal and made up of atoms and empty space -- death is the end of the body and the soul (as the soul is made up of atoms that scatter at death)

Your state at death is the same as your state before you were born, namely, the non-state of nonexistence.

> “Therefore death, the most terrifying of evils, is nothing
to us, since for the time when we are, death is not
present; and for the time when death is present, we
are not. Therefore it is nothing either to the living or
the dead since it is not present for the former, and
the latter are no longer.”
