> The powerful tend to have appropriate understandings of their experiences ready to draw on as they make sense of their social experiences, whereas the powerless are more likely to find themselves having some social experiences through a glass darkly, with a best ill-fitting meanings to draw on in the effort to render them intelligible

**Hermeneutical injustice** is a subcategory of [epistemic injustice](thoughts/epistemic%20injustice.md) wherein one has no labels/common terminology to describe or explain experiences to others. Historically has been applied in the context of exclusion of marginalized groups from activities which shape the language we use.

Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation.

> It is the injustice of having some significant area of one's social experience obscured from collective understanding owing to a structural identity prejudice in the collective hermeneutical resource

It is always a form of powerlessness, whether structural or one-off. If one can simply *opt-out*, then it should not be considered hermeneutical injustice.

> "the dominated live in a world **structured** by others for their purposes" (emphasis added)

This quotes from Nancy Hartsock has at least 3 different readings of the meaning of the word structured
1. Materially: social institutions and practices favour the powerful
2. Ontologically: the powerful constitute the social world
3. [Epistemologically](thoughts/epistemology.md): the powerful have an unfair advantage in structuring collective social understandings
