Is there a hard truth to anything in the universe? Can we truly know anything?

"The word “axiom” means self evident truth. All of mathematics are models based on frameworks of axioms and postulates. We develop proofs and theorems from these. All facts and axioms in mathematics are fundamentally flawed.

are ideas inherently different from facts?
what are the universal axioms of the universe?
descartes
* solipsism -> we can only know that we exist

## Gödel's incompleteness theorem
[A great explanation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeQX2HjkcNo)

There will always be statements that are true that **cannot** be proven

It basically states that if math is consistent, it cannot be complete. And if it is not complete, it must not be consistent."

Related to Conway's Game of Life and whether we can tell a program can halt or not.

## Verisimilitude
Truth is not binary, but rather a spectrum. Some propositions are closer to being true than other propositions.

Very related to the work of Karl Popper and the iterative approach to science.

## Descartes' Meditations
### First Meditation → skeptical doubts
-   descartes wants to find a foundation of knowledge that will still stand strong even after doubting the most basic facts about the world
-   everything descartes has accepted has true has come through senses, but senses can deceive
-   First Argument
    1.  Some experiences are deceptive (e.g. visual illusions, mirages)
    2.  Any particular experience I have might be deceptive
    3.  It is possible that _all_ my experiences are deceptive
-   Counterexample to first argument
    -   Some paintings are forgegeries
    -   Any particular painting might be a forgery
    -   It is possible that all paintings are forgeries
    -   can't be possible because all paintings if all paintings are forgeries, what are they based off of?
-   Descartes' objection to First Argument
    -   premise 2 doesn't work → any particular experience I have might be deceptive
    -   I am sure of my own thoughts
        -   And yet to have these doubts, he must exist. For an evil demon to mislead him in all these insidious ways, he must exist in order to be misled.
        -   Therefore, thought above all else is inseparable from being. The Meditator concludes that, in the strict sense, he is only a thing that thinks.
### Dream Argument
-   Premises
	1.  i have dreamt at being at my desk
	2.  when i dreamt it, i believed it was true
	3.  when i dreamt it, it was false
	4.  there is no way to tell whether you are dreaming or awake
-   Conclusion → i don't know that I am here at my desk right now
-   as premise 4 is roughly equivalent to the conclusion, this argument is invalid
	-   begs the question → argument which has a premise as a conclusion (circular reasoning)
### The God argument
-   suppose there exists an evil demon, just as powerful as God, but which deceives me about everything he can
-   descartes refutation
	-   it seems possible for there to be such a person
	-   if there were such a person, then everything I believe would be false
	-   I can't tell that there isn't such a person
	-   so, I don't really know anything I thought i knew
