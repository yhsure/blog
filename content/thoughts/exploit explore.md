-   exploit-explore tradeoff in ML
    -   hill climbing/optimization problem
    -   always jump to next step up â†’ greedy search
-   optimizing to find one's true [values](thoughts/value%20setting.md)

## Pendulum of life
[Source: The Joy of Wasting Time by *Samson Zhang*](https://www.samsonzhang.com/2021/01/26/the-joy-of-wasting-time-the-exploration-exploitation-tradeoff-of-life.html)

"The ideal is to find an equilibrium point between external pulls and internal pushes, between exploitation (of your current opportunities via external pulls) and exploration (of your actual passions via internal pushes)... the process of finding equilibrium often takes the form of a damped oscillation over time"

## Notes
- how much of this is just [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback%20loops.md) but for learning/interests?
- how does [play](thoughts/play.md) fit into this?

## Regret Minimization Framework

Project yourself to age 80 and look back on your life. How do I minimize the regrets that I have? Will you regret abandoning this idea?

> When you minimize future regret, you sleep well knowing you're maximizing fulfilment.

Is a life well-lived one that is fully maximized? What if I just want to live for vibes (which are inherently unoptimizable)?
