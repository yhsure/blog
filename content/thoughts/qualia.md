Qualia: the subjective, conscious experience.

> Examples of qualia include the perceived sensation of _pain_ of a headache, the _taste_ of wine, as well as the _redness_ of an evening sky

## Vibes
[Source](https://reallifemag.com/nameless-feeling/)

Neural networks just assess vibes, they are the literal technical implementation of "no thoughts, just vibes".

Vibes are very similar to the approximations [machine learning systems](thoughts/machine%20learning.md) use. Both suffer from [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md)

On context-less data: Like vibes, these metrics carry no context or narrative; they can tell you nothing about how or why something might be desirable

Is [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md) derivative with vibes/qualia too?

## Hard problem of consciousness
How do we bridge objective description and subjective experience

what gives rise to [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) (rel: [emergent behaviour](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md)), first-person experiences, and a sense of self?

Do inanimate and non-human intelligences have personal experiences?
