Potential exploration on my gripes with existing [[thoughts/tools for thought|tools for thought]] using principles from [[thoughts/Rhizome Proposal|Rhizome]]. Extracted from my [[thoughts/idea list|idea list]]

- transclusion of blocks supported by default
- full revision history w granularity of single operations
- write first, organize later: always-on 'default note'
	- make it super easy to split out content into a new note
	* good daily notes, choose what to carry over from the previous day
	* https://www.inkandswitch.com/crosscut/ -> Thoughts move quickly, so the tools we use to make our models must be fast to use and readily available
		* should be even easier than just pen and paper
* block based editors are neat cause i can move stuff around really easily
	* if u drag outside the page it makes a new note, super easy to break down big complex topics into more granular/atomic notes
	* spatially consistent? [memory palace](thoughts/memory%20palace.md) vibes -> https://twitter.com/jordanmoore/status/1418942880941477891
* card based backlinks/outgoing links
	* on the left, you can see all the notes that link to the current page
	* on the right, you can see all outgoing links
	* hovering on each card will reveal another layer which those ones are connected to
* graph view
	* i wanted to have the option for 3d graphs too
* timeline view
	* each note will come with a date so you can chronologically order notes and view them that way (kind of like a git history) if ur brain works better that way
* good global search
	* being able to index content fast and effectively
* [interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md) of data, easy export
