## Section I: Trusting Institutions
> Is it ever responsible to trust an institution about something that outstrips your individual ability to verify? Explain why. If you answer yes, how do you ground this trust? If you answer no, how do you deal with the fact that trusting at least some institutions is central to the success of (at least a democratic, arguably any contemporary human) society?

- define responsibility as justified belief, a trust that is explainable and within one's control, rational to believe in it
- answer differs between
	1. Epistemic Trust: trust in someone as a speaker or source of knowledge
	2. Practical Trust: trust in someone as an actor
- argue that epistemic trust in institutions that is not verifiable is not responsible, practical trust in institutions that is not verifiable IS responsible
- argue that no for epistemic trust if its non-verifiable
	- e.g. in the cases of govt public health announcements -> linked to evidence backed and supposedly reproducible science publications
		- scientific method is about doubt
		- hypotheses need to be refutable
	- from the perspective of religious texts, even if the institution were to be a flawless revealed source, it wouldn't help
	- [Vedic] words do not [themselves] declare: "This is our meaning, not this." This meaning [which Vedic words have] must be postulated by humans. The later are possessed, however, of [moral defects] like desire. Besides, how is the distinction made that among [such humans] one knows what [the meaning of the Veda] really is, the other doesn't? Why isn't there for you in some way some [other person who is] knowledgeable [of the meaning,] given that he is as human as the [other]? (Dharmakīrti, PV 1.312-313)
	- A revealed source still has to be interpreted and this necessarily happens through human interactions mediated by language
- how do we deal with trusting *some* institutions? practical trust yea
	- researchers are justified in believing the results of AI systems because there is a reliable process that yields, most of the time, trustworthy results. 
	- why can't be treat institutions like computational boxes?
		- cant verify that its the best decision at the moment but historically has been effective
		- similar to Duran and Jongsma's Computational Reliability
			- verification + validation
			- robustness analysis
			- history of (un)successful implementations
			- expert knowledge
	- Goldman, 5 main pieces of evidence for trust
		1. Arguments presented by the contending to support their own views and critique their rival's views
		2. Agreement from additional putative experts on one side or other of the subject in question
		3. Appraisals by "meta-experts" of the experts' expertise
		4. Evidence of the expert's interests and biases vis-a-vis the question at issue
		5. Evidence of the expert's past track-records

## Section II: Resolving the pickle
> In the final episode of Marvel's TV series _Loki_, Loki and Sylvie have the following exchange:
> 
> SYLVIE: What was I thinking trusting you? Has this whole thing been a con?
> 
> LOKI: Really? That’s what you think of me… after all this time? Sure. Why not? Evil Loki’s master plan comes together. Well, you never trusted me, did you? What was the point? Can’t you see? This is bigger than our experience.
> 
> SYLVIE: Why aren’t we seeing this the same way?
> 
> LOKI: Because you can’t trust… and I can’t be trusted.
> 
> SYLVIE: Then I guess we’re in a pickle.
> 
> Your assignment is to solve the pickle. You can do this by either convincing Sylvie to trust Loki (and by extension He Who Remains), or by convincing Loki that Sylvie's right and no one (or at least no one in this room, but if not them, then who and about what?) should be trusted. Remember that both Loki and Sylvie are very smart and very attached to their respective viewpoints, so you'll have to both 1) show them that you understand their point of view (by incorporating counter-arguments to the position you're arguing in favor of), and 2) give them some new epistemic tools to understand their situation differently if you're going to be convincing.

- looking at multiple different perspectives on epistemic trust and reliability
- trust as unquestioning attitude
- partiality and prejudice in trusting -> im a friend, you should trust me
- how can we trust he who remains? (beyond verifiable)
	- upside and risk
- testimonial injustice
	- Sylvie is Loki from an alternative timeline, who was "pruned" (=sent to be killed) as a child by the organization overseen by He Who Remains, but escaped and has been plotting revenge her entire life
	- by default does not trust He Who Remains
