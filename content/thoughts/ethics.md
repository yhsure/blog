Ethics is the rational systematic analysis of **morality**. Morality is the compass of what people ought to or ought not to do.

Workable ethical theory: produces explanations that aim to be persuasive to a skeptical, yet open-minded audience

Especially important for technologists to grapple with as common wisdom may not exist for novel situations brought about by new technologies (see: [[thoughts/Collingridge dilemma|Collingridge Dillemma]])

## 4 Unworkable Ethical Theories
1. Subjective Relativism: "who are you to criticise my values"
	- There's no universal standard of right or wrong, each individual must decide for themselves
	- *Everything* is equally valid, not that "I can see how people can arrive at different conclusions"
2. Cultural Relativism: "who are you to criticise my culture's values"
	- Moral actions are based on a culture's actual moral guidelines
	- It is presumptuous to judge another culture's values
3. Divine Command Theory: "stealing is wrong because the Bible says so"
	- We should use holy books (or any sort of appeal to authority) as guides for moral decision making
	- Only effective to those who already believe in the same beliefs as us
4. Ethical Egoism
	- People's self-interest is their only ethical obligation
	- What's good for the market is good for society
