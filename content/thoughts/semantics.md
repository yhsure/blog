> What do words or sentences mean

Meanings are public property: the same meaning be grasped by more than one person and by people at different times. Heavily related to [representation](thoughts/representation.md)

## Implications
- If this argument is correct, then the content of our thoughts partly depends on what is in the world we live in
- Content determines object
	- What about indexical thoughts? Thoughts that depend on context like "you", "me", "there", "here"
- Concept of meaning rests on two unchallenged assumptions
    - Understanding a word (knowing its intension) was just a matter of being in a certain psychological state
    -   meaning of a term determines its extension
        -   extension → actual physical manifestation / what it is
-   proving these are false → [Twin Earth Argument](thoughts/Twin%20Earth%20Argument.md)
    -   extension of the term is not a function of the psychological state of the speaker by itself
        -   water on twin earth vs earth in 1750; both oscars think it to be the same thing

## Sociolinguistic hypothesis
-   division of linguistic labour
	-   some people wear gold rings
	-   some people tell the difference between gold and non-gold
	-   not everyone needs to tell the difference between gold and non-gold, rely on the judgement of experts
	-   formal: "every linguistic community exemplifies the sort of division of linguistic labour just described; that is, it possesses at least some terms whose associated "criteria" a re known only to a subset of the speakers who acquire the terms, and whose use by the other speakers depends upon a structured cooperation between them and the speakers in the relevant subsets"
-   two theories → if "water" means $H_2O$ in $W_1$ and "water" means $XYZ$ in $W_2$
	1.  world-relative but constant in meaning, 'water' means the same thing in both world, but water is $H_2O$ in $W_1$ and water is $XYZ$ in $W_2$
	2.  water is $H_2O$ in all worlds, but 'water' doesn't mean the same thing in $W_1$ and $W_2$
- Twin-earth argument implies 2nd one is true
- Rigidity → if a designator in a particular sentence refers to the same individual in every possible w in W
	- Water is rigid in (2)
- Once we have discovered the nature of water, nothing counts as a possible world in which water doesn't have nature
	- i.e. one we have discovered that water (in the actual world) is h2o, nothing counts as a possible world in which water isn't h2o
- Water at another time or in another place or even in another possible world has to bear the relation same to our "water" in order to be water
- Types of statements
	- [[thoughts/epistemology|epistemically]] necessary → rationally unrevisable
	- [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysically]] necessary → true in all possible worlds

## Lexical Development
- Mental lexicon: mental dictionary of word knowledge (how it sounds, grammar, definition, etc.)
- Word: symbol that refers to something
- Symbol: stands for something without being a part of that something
- Context-bound word: things tied to particular contexts (word use is more specific than actual meaning)
- Nominals: names for things
- Natural partitions hypothesis: the physical world makes obvious the things that take nouns as labels, whereas the meanings that verbs encode have to be figured out from hearing the verb in use
- Relational relativity hypothesis: possibility that verb meanings will vary from language to language (linguistic work showing that noun meanings are more similar across languages than are verb meanings)
- Word extension: to what extent is a word valid?
	- Underextensions: using words in a more restricted fashion
	- Overextensions: using words in a more broad fashion (for related study, see Naigles & Gelman 1995 study, results showed that overextensions are mistakes, they don’t indicate incorrect understanding of the words)
	- Protowords (also known as phonetically consistent forms -- PCFs)
		- Phonetically consistent: the child uses the same word every time.
	- Things that help with accurate word extension:
		- Taxonomic extension: words to things are actually taxonomies (they are of the same category)
- Word spurt: see Choi & Gopnik (1995)
- Types of language use, two ends of a continuum
	- Referential language style: more object labels
	- Expressive language style: relatively fewer object object labels and more personal/social words
- Mapping problem: how do we know what the new word refers to?
	- Fast mapping: initial hypothesis about word meaning
	- Lexical principles/lexical constraints: guides that limit possible interpretations of new words
		- Whole-object assumption: words refer to whole objects
		- Assumption of mutual exclusivity: different words refer to different kinds of things. No category overlap
	- Lexical gaps: Sometimes things are not a one-to-one match – your language may not have a lexical item for something
- Age at which children learn early words (first 50-100) can vary a lot due to
	- Environmental Factors
		- Language experience and input
		- Socioeconomic status (SES)
		- Birth order
	- Individual Factors
		- Processing speed
		- Phonological memory
		- Personality and temperament
