# Putnam
-   meanings are public property → the same meaning be grasped by more than one person and by persons at different times
## Putnam's argument
-   my twin is thinking of XYZ and I am thinking of H2O
-   XYZ ≠ H2O
-   content determines object (frege: the sense of a term determines its referent)
-   if t1 and t2 have different objects, then they must also have different content
-   twin and I have thoughts with different content
-   thoughts are individuated by their content
-   twin and I h ave different thoughts even though we are molecule-for-molecule duplicates
## Implications
-   if this argument is correct, then the content of our thoughts partly depends on what is in the world we live in (we can't be BIVs)
-   content determines object
	-   what about indexical thoughts? → thoughts that depend on context like "you", "me", "there", "here"
-   concept of meaning rests on two unchallenged assumptions
    -   understanding a word (knowing its intension) was just a matter of being in a certain psychological state
    -   meaning of a term determines its extension
        -   extension → actual physical manifestation / what it is
-   proving these are false → twin earth theory
    -   extension of the term is not a function of the psychological state of the speaker by itself
        -   water on twin earth vs earth in 1750; both oscars think it to be the same thing
    -   "the fact that an English speaker in 1750 might have called XYZ "water," whereas she or his successors would not have called XYZ water in 1800 or 1850 does not mean that the "meaning" of 'water' changed for the average speaker in the interval
## Sociolinguistic hypothesis
-   division of linguistic labour
	-   some people wear gold rings
	-   some people tell the difference between gold and non-gold
	-   not everyone needs to tell the difference between gold and non-gold, rely on the judgement of experts
	-   formal: "every linguistic community exemplifies the sort of division of linguistic labour just described; that is, it possesses at least some terms whose associated "criteria" a re known only to a subset of the speakers who acquire the terms, and whose use by the other speakers depends upon a structured cooperation between them and the speakers in the relevant subsets"
-   two theories → if "water" means H2O in W1 and "water" means XYZ in W2
	1.  world-relative but constant in meaning, 'water' means the same thing in both world, but water is H2O in W1 and water is XYZ in W2
		predicate → for every world W, for every x in W, x is water === x == water in W
	2.  water is h2o in all world, 'water' doesn't mean the same thing in W1 and W2
		predicate → for every world W, for every x in W, x is water === x == water in W1 (actual world)
-   twin-earth argument implies 2nd one is true
-   rigidity → if a designator in a particular sentence refers to the same individual in every possible w in W
	-   water is rigid in (2)
-   once we have discovered the nature of water, nothing counts as a possible world in which water doesn't have nature
	-   i.e. one we have discovered that water (in the actual world) is h2o, nothing counts as a possible world in which water isn't h2o
-   water at another time or in another place or even in another possible world has to bear the relation same to our "water" in order to be water
-   types of statements
	-   epistemically necessary → rationally unrevisable
	-   metaphysically necessary → true in all possible worlds

# Pryor
## Matrix
-   matrix implies that there's something bad about being inside the Matrix
-   who is the matrix supposed to be bad for?
-   machines are using the Matrix to keep humans docile to use them as a source of energy
    -   a form of slavery
    -   what if it was instead benevolent and philanthropic? would this change how we see the situation?
-   "if in every respect it seems to you that you're in the good situation, doesn't that make it true— at least, true for you — that you are in the good situation?
-   Usually when two people disagree about some matter, they agree that the fact they're disputing is an objective one.
-   3 possibilities for what would be "bad" about living in the matrix
    -   scientific knowledge
    -   interpersonal relationships
    -   being slaves — albeit content ones
        -   the matrix is computer-generated dream world, built to keep us under control
-   meaning in the matrix
    -   do the things in the matrix refer to their "real" counterparts?
    -   "steak" and "air" refer to the actual things inside of the matrix for those who have spent their whole life in the matrix
        -   mean something very different for outsiders who just visit
## Verificationist
- rejecting that the idea of certain facts are objective
    -   For example, a verificationist about height would say that how tall you are depends on what evidence there is about how tall you are.
    -   The only height you can have is a height that in principle, discoverable or verifiable that you have
    -   if its true from one's perspective, its their truth → "If all my evidence says that there is a tall mountain there, then in my personal picture of the world there is a tall mountain there. That's all it can mean, for me, to say that there's a tall mountain there. The mountain really is there, for me, so long as it appears real, and fits my conception of a tall mountain."
    -   "if tree falls and nobody hears it, did it really fall?"
-   "pursuing our own ends, and trying to satisfy our own desires" ≠ "acting for a selfish motive."
    -   psychological egoism (PE) → people always act in their own self-interest
    -   If my motive is to make me better off, then my motive is a selfish one. If my motive is to make you better off, then my motive is not selfish.
-   are bad things bad if you don't know about it?
    -   most people would agree yes
    -   why is that?
