Meanings are public property: the same meaning be grasped by more than one person and by people at different times. Heavily related to [representation](thoughts/representation.md)

## Implications
-   if this argument is correct, then the content of our thoughts partly depends on what is in the world we live in
-   content determines object
	-   what about indexical thoughts? → thoughts that depend on context like "you", "me", "there", "here"
-   concept of meaning rests on two unchallenged assumptions
    -   understanding a word (knowing its intension) was just a matter of being in a certain psychological state
    -   meaning of a term determines its extension
        -   extension → actual physical manifestation / what it is
-   proving these are false → [Twin Earth Argument](thoughts/Twin%20Earth%20Argument.md)
    -   extension of the term is not a function of the psychological state of the speaker by itself
        -   water on twin earth vs earth in 1750; both oscars think it to be the same thing

## Sociolinguistic hypothesis
-   division of linguistic labour
	-   some people wear gold rings
	-   some people tell the difference between gold and non-gold
	-   not everyone needs to tell the difference between gold and non-gold, rely on the judgement of experts
	-   formal: "every linguistic community exemplifies the sort of division of linguistic labour just described; that is, it possesses at least some terms whose associated "criteria" a re known only to a subset of the speakers who acquire the terms, and whose use by the other speakers depends upon a structured cooperation between them and the speakers in the relevant subsets"
-   two theories → if "water" means H2O in W1 and "water" means XYZ in W2
	1.  world-relative but constant in meaning, 'water' means the same thing in both world, but water is H2O in W1 and water is XYZ in W2
		predicate → for every world W, for every x in W, x is water === x == water in W
	2.  water is h2o in all world, 'water' doesn't mean the same thing in W1 and W2
		predicate → for every world W, for every x in W, x is water === x == water in W1 (actual world)
-   twin-earth argument implies 2nd one is true
-   rigidity → if a designator in a particular sentence refers to the same individual in every possible w in W
	-   water is rigid in (2)
-   once we have discovered the nature of water, nothing counts as a possible world in which water doesn't have nature
	-   i.e. one we have discovered that water (in the actual world) is h2o, nothing counts as a possible world in which water isn't h2o
-   water at another time or in another place or even in another possible world has to bear the relation same to our "water" in order to be water
-   types of statements
	-   epistemically necessary → rationally unrevisable
	-   metaphysically necessary → true in all possible worlds

- would the experiences in [Nozick's Experience Machine](thoughts/Nozick's%20Experience%20Machine.md) be the same as real ones?
