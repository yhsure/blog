Questions:
1. How can we create tools that aid our thinking?
2. As an extension, how do we organize the abundance of [information](thoughts/information.md) we have today so that it is both accessible and useful?
3. How do we distill all the [research debt](thoughts/articles/research-debt.md) so that our ideas are easily useful to others?
4. Can we create tools that enable [collaborative-thinking](posts/collaborative-thinking.md)? Is it possible to enable idea-to-idea instead of idea-to-words-to-idea?

## On memory
> If a tree fell and nobody remembered, did it really happen?

Very 1984-line-of-thought but those who control the past, how we remember and what history is, controls the present and thus controls the future.

Our tools of memory should be democratized and public. These tools are a [public good](thoughts/public-goods.md). They are, quite literally, the [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) for mental representations and operations. These are the patterns the dictate our very mental processes.

## Kernel

We live in an information age. The amount of data we produce far outweighs what we consume, so much so that its extended far beyond our ability to make meaningful use of it. Even our modern day [search](thoughts/search.md) systems seem to be [falling apart](thoughts/search-or-be-found.md) under the stress of todays overwhelming flow of data.

> "There is a growing mountain of research [but we] cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, all the conclusions of others as they appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial [...]

A record should be able to be
1. continuously extended
2. stored
3. consulted (e.g. through search)

Right now, most [organizing systems](thoughts/organizing-systems.md) are really good at 1) and 2) but suck at 3).

We're trying to build tools that allow association between ideas easily, relying on relations and relatedness [without forcing hierarchies or classification straight away](thoughts/articles/city-is-not-a-tree.md). Then, the path through these ideas can be thought of as 'user trails'. 

### Chunking
We naturally group things into patterns and chunks and allow us to think on and rationalize at higher levels of abstraction, descending into lower levels only when we need to.

This was demonstrated by chess masters in the 1970's: "Players learn to recognize somewhere between 25,000 and 100,000 **patterns of chess pieces**. These much more elaborate 'chunks' are combinations of pieces that the players **perceive as a unity**, and are able to reason about at a higher level of abstraction than the individual pieces"

Is it possible to automatically pick up repeated digital desire paths of user trails and pull them into [workflows](thoughts/workflows.md)? take advantage of natural spaced repetition to identify saliency

Can we build [memory palaces](thoughts/memory-palace.md)?

The focus of modern information systems is moving from "data-processing" towards "concept-processing", meaning that the basic unit of processing is less and less an atomic piece of data and is becoming more a semantic concept which caries an interpretation and exists in a context with other concepts.

### Emotion
Video is incredibly expressive. You can *feel* the passion of people who really care about the things they study, build, and work on.

Is it possible to create mediums for thought that convey 'awe and mystery and surprise and beauty'? I really hope so.

### Execution
Can we embed computation into our notes? Create APIs out of our thoughts and concepts? Compose theorems just as easily as we chain function calls?
