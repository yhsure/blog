supervenience → when A supervenes on B, there can be no difference in A without a difference in B
	-   vending machine example
	-   A is monetary value
	-   B is physical coin
	-   weak supervenience → someone is keeping it going by manipulating it. If they stop, the supervenience is no longer there
	-   strong supervenience → direct linear relation (e.g. speed of molecules of gas and temperature, they are directly correlated), based off of the rules of the universe
-   in dretske
	-   relies on the weak supervenience the government supports (i.e. that coins in a certain shape have monetary value)
-   ideal conditions → representation carries out its natural function
-   mind is to intentional actions what money is to the behaviour of a vending machine
    -   coins are deposited in the vending machine → beliefs, desires, and intentions, are in, or get produced in, us
    -   right coins deposited in the machine cause it to dispense a can of coke → the right mental entities occurring in us cause us to perform various actions
    -   what makes money money is not intrinsic (not shape, size, or density), but rather extrinsic or relational in nature (coins possess monetary value) → what makes a belief a belief is not its intrinsic neurobiological character, but rather extrinsic facts about it (has certain meaning or content, intentional properties)
        -   intrinsic → physical features
        -   extrinsic → added value through supervenience (something that if an alien came, they wouldn't be able to figure out just from looking at it)
