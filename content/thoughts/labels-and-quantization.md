Our obsession of applying labels to everything extends to even whether a [hot dog is a sandwhich or not](https://www.hot-dog.org/culture/hot-dog-sandwich)

"Accuracy is more useful in entry-level jobs and for novices, because as skill increases, quantification of skill becomes harder."

"This is because feedback loops which are too short for the overall system makes people focus on inappropriate intermediate goals."
* dangers of intermediate proxies?
* what about in machine learning? using certain quantities for metrics which are just *proxies* for more difficult to measure qualitative end goals

Applicable to [feedback-loops](/thoughts/feedback-loops)
"Focusing on tight feedback also leads to getting stuck in local maxima. The short turnaround time leads to the pursuit of incremental improvements. Accurate feedback reduces error, but this means reaching and staying at the local maximum. The more accurate and more rapid the loop, the more quickly you’ll arrive at the top of the hill – and the less chance you have of leaving it to climb the mountains of mastery."
* [exploit-explore](/thoughts/exploit-explore) algorithm 

"When quantifying things, people naturally focus on things that can easily be measured. Measuring the final result doesn’t provide enough quantitative data, so it’s tempting to include the data from intermediate steps. This is an attempt to shorten the feedback loop, and trying to shorten feedback loops is very dangerous in complex systems."

## Qualia
Is there any anyway to label or quantify the subjective human experience? Probably not.

If the same apple sends two very different signals to two different people's brains, how is it that we decipher it to be [semantically](thoughts/semantics.md) identical?

Not sure if there's any way to easily do this

## Nonsemantic Information
"[the] shadows, wind, rust, in the signs of wear on a well-trodden staircase, the creaks of a battered bridge — all the indexical messages of our material environments" From [A city is not a computer](thoughts/articles/a-city-is-not-a-computer.md)

## Phrases
### Goodhart's Law
> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure" -- [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)

### McNamara Fallacy
Also known as the quantitative fallacy: making a decision involving purely quantitative observations (ignoring all others) is often wrong. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy)

## Are labels helpful? 
In a data-driven world, can we and should we try to quantize everything? What about inherently human qualities like emotions or personality?

some metrics that are inherently v difficult to quantize (e.g. quality of engagement) and others that are more easy to quantize and thus optimize for (like engagement)

No matter how much data we collect, two people who look the same to the algorithm can always end up making different choices.

We gave you two definitions of fairness: keep the error rates comparable between groups, and treat people with the same risk scores in the same way. Both of these definitions are totally defensible! But satisfying both at the same time is impossible.
