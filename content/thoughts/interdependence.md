- Dependent Existence: for a flower to exist and for us to have experienced it requires the existence of many others. The gardener, the sun, the water, the minerals, the soil.
	- In cognitive science, concept of [connectionist representation](thoughts/representation.md)
	- In [emergent systems](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md), there is no 'conductor' there is only a symphony that interdepend on each other
- Independent Existence: a separate existence. A flower cannot be by herself or have a self-nature (svabhāva).

> In order to change, I had to accept that other people aren’t fundamentally responsible for my emotional state. _I’m_ responsible for my emotional state. I think I’ve realized this most acutely through writing, which is so individual and painful—no one can really help me with it. It has to be self-generated. Other people can help you edit, and give you feedback, and read over your drafts, but it has to come from you. That’s how everything works, right? No one can help you self-actualize except you.
