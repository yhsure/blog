## A Philosophy of Games
A Philosophy of Games that is really a Philosophy of Life with [C. Thi Nguyen](https://overcast.fm/+oiPXNKQBw)

## [Quantization](thoughts/quantization.md)
-  “The most important thing in my game designer toolbox is the point system because the point system tells the players what to care about.” -- Reiner Knizia
- "Quantified measures are extremely good tools for large-scale bureaucracies to organize themselves"
- Metrics and quantities carve out all of the subtle nuance and all the weird little information that needs a lot of shared context to understand *so* that it can travel and be transported between contexts and let it aggregate easily
	- "So if you have large-scale bureaucracies that need to be organized and function coherently, then you need these kind of simple, nuance-free packets of [information](thoughts/information.md)"
- "if you spend your life playing games, you’ll expect that value systems will be crisp, clear, well-defined, and quantified. And then you leave games, you’ll start looking around for— I don’t know— things to do, or institutions to be a part of, or jobs to do where the outcomes are clear, crystallized, quantified, and shared between people"

### On social media
- A lot of times people click like because something made them laugh for a second, not because it moved them two weeks later.

## Aesthetics
- Object aesthetics: when an artist makes a thing like a painting. And you look at the thing and the thing is beautiful
- Process aesthetics: the artist makes a thing and you interact with the thing and you’re beautiful. Your actions are beautiful, or comic, or thrilling. (I think games fall under this later category)

### Games are the crystallization of doing
- The visual arts are the crystallization of seeing... music is a crystallization of hearing... fiction is a crystallization of story telling... games are the crystallization of doing.
	- The game designer tells you what abilities you have and what obstacles you’ll face, but most importantly, what goals you’ll have: games are the art form that works in the medium of agency itself
- Follows Bernard's definition of a game in [The Grasshopper](thoughts/The%20Grasshopper.md): to play a game is to voluntarily take on unnecessary obstacles for the sake of making possible the activity of overcoming them

## Agency
- I feel like games are like an existential balm for the horror of life. A lot of life is you don’t fit. You have to do things. And it sucks and it’s horrible and it’s boring. And in games, for once in your life, you know exactly what you’re doing and you know exactly that you can do it. And then you have just the right amount of ability to do it. It’s a feeling of concentrated, crystallized action
- Game designers have sculpted these little **action universes** so that we can step into them and just have this ecstasy over and over again.
- “I’m more worried about games breeding more Wall Street profiteers than I am about their breeding serial killers.”
	- The greatest power of games is that you can explore this landscape of different agencies. The greatest danger of games is that you can get sucked into this experience of just craving and wanting to be in a clear, crisp and gentle universe where you know exactly what to do and exactly how well it’s measured (similar concerns to [Goodhart's Law](thoughts/Goodhart's%20Law.md)).
	- So I think that the body of games is a kind of library of agencies. The real promise of games, if you take them seriously, is that by playing a ton of them, you can traverse all the different possibilities of agency.

### Misc
- "'Train' ... looks like, in many ways, a standard European board game. You’re building a railway network. You’re trying to optimize it. And over time the game reveals to you that what you’re actually doing is it’s Nazi Germany and you’re building the railway network to move people to concentration camps."
