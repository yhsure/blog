# Personal Thoughts
## Bridging the real and the virtual
-   moving away from personal computing
    -   started off with timeshare
    -   personal computing
    -   now streaming EVERYTHING to the cloud
    -   devices will just be viewing places

No matter how hard we try, our virtual selves will inevitably be tethered to our physical selves. Interface with these virtual worlds through looking at our screens, typing on our keyboards, etc. even with a [pseudonymous-web](/thoughts/articles/pseudonymous-web) that is not supposedly tied to anything in the physical realm.

In a world where scarcity is constructed, do we even need to use it? Can we rely on manipulating abundance ([agalmics](thoughts/positive-sum.md)) through [incentives](thoughts/incentives.md)?

### Crypto
Crypto still needs to be converted to fiat? Can we have a fully crypto economy?

Crypto has managed to build infrastructures that exist outside the nation state, but we still live our lives embedded in places, communities, and nations. How do we bridge that gap?

## Physical Touch
> "One concern, though, is that some social skills may not develop as effectively when so many interactions exist online. We learn how we are and aren’t supposed to act by observing others and then having opportunities to act out our observations ourselves."

"On the internet, you can pull the plug and walk away. There’s no forcing mechanism that makes us have to learn" -> how do we keep people digitally accountable?

[Dunbar](https://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-media-affect-math-dunbar-number-friendships) and his colleagues demonstrated that very light touch triggers a cascade of endorphins that, in turn, are important for creating personal relationships. Can this be replicated virtually?

# Nozick
-   hedonism → only pleasure or pain motivates us
## Experience machine
-   suppose there was a machine that would give you any experience you desired
-   would you plug in?

1.  If "how things seem to be" is the only thing that matters to us, we have no reason to refuse this offer
2.  we are hesitant to take up this offer (we have reasons to refuse it)

	1.  “We want to docertain things, and not just have the experience of doing them.” (43)
	2.  “... we want to be a certain way, to be a certain sort of person.” (43)
	3.  We want to leave ourselves open to contact with a deeper reality.

	-   what if we made machines to tackle all of this reasons? e.g. a transformation machine, result machine, etc.
	-   these machines are disturbing because they are living our lives for us
3.  therefore, experiences aren't the only thing that matter to us
