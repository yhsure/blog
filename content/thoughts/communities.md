## Types of Communities
1.  Interest-based → same interests/passions
2.  Location-based → same geographical location, place of work, etc.
3.  Vibe-based → group energy
4.  Circumstance-based → external influence, put into the same group

Can we ever have fully [digital commons](thoughts/digital%20commons.md)?

How large can communities get before they decay? Relevant: [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md)

## Ingroup/outgroup biases
-   get social status points
-   we will choose to identify with whatever in-group will immediately benefit us the most
-   why soririties + frats are successful → sunk cost falacy
-   amount of boundaries required → well organized events vs serendipitous interactions
	-   do serendipitous interactions only come from [ephemereal content](thoughts/ephemereal%20content.md)?

## Turing Test
*heuristic* from Austin Wu

A very [computational](thoughts/computability.md) view of communities but is it possible to test for value alignment within a community like a Turing Test? If the community feels and behaves like a person, then its [values](thoughts/value%20setting.md) are aligned?

How do we quantify this if vibes are unoptimizable?

## 90/9/1 Rule
The "90–9–1" version of this rule states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing.

Was called "participation inequality" by researchers at AT&T labs

 the 80/20 rule known as the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle "Pareto principle") states that 20 percent of a group will produce 80 percent of the activity, however the activity is defined.
 
 a type of power law (zipf's law)
 
 Size of the community might matter? a form of [Dunbar's number](thoughts/group%20limits.md) e.g.
* small communities like family group chats -> almost everyone creates content
* large communities like LinkedIn -> most people consume, vocal minority
 
though size might just be a proxy for sense of belonging in a group. i.e. if you strongly identify with said group (family) you are more likely to participate and contribute

in larger communities then, the approximately normal distribution of people who are engaged in the community may lead to some type of power law

## Moderation
Related: [community governance](thoughts/governance.md)

What is the role of moderation in a community? What does good/bad moderation look like? (posts/comments/membership)

I think a key part of answering this is trying to define what role a community occupies. Is it just a collection of people gathering around a shared identity? Or is it supposed to be a platform for moderated idea discussion/generation? Or something else in between.

Thinking about this at the [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) level too, if a community's purpose is to serve as infrastructure so that it enables conversations, should infrastructure be regulated/enforced or something that should just play out naturally?

Broadly defined, I see moderation as having two main categories: moderation of users and moderation of content. Moderation then, is to ensure that the set of values that is being conveyed by the users/content roughly aligns with that of the group/community.

Moderation of users involves regulating the *membership* of individuals within the community whereas moderation of content regulates what can/can't be said in the community.

Moderation gets problematic when it is used to target and discriminate against individuals because of personal relations or vendettas. I was thinking about also saying it becomes problematic when it discriminates against characteristics but I'm hesitant on this bit. Is it categorically different to exclude people who are misogynistic vs those of a certain race? Probably yes but I don't have a solid argument for it yet.
