## Ingroup/outgroup biases
-   get social status points
-   we will choose to identify with whatever in-group will immediately benefit us the most
-   why soririties + frats are successful → sunk cost falacy
-   amount of boundaries required → well organized events vs serendipitous interactions
	-   do serendipitous interactions only come from [ephemereal-content](/thoughts/ephemereal-content.md)?

## Community Governance
-   bottom-up emergent properties vs top-down governance
-   homeostasis of communities
    -   mix of internal and external influence
    -   secluded vs public
-   [labels-and-quantization](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md)
    -   conforming to labels
    -   self-fulfilling prophecies
-   sanctity of natural interactions
    -   monetizing human interaction (ondeck)
    -   how do we screen for value alignment?
        -   interviews? (two-way vibe check)
        -   publishing list of values
        -   why introductions are hard: [introductions](thoughts/introductions.md)
            -   can never fully/properly frame yourself
