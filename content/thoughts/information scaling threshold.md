When a society hits this information threshold, it stops functioning until it can invent new ways to sense make with the new abundance of information. If they don't pull that transition off, they die.

The [[thoughts/attention economy]] is a symptom human society hitting this information scaling threshold. Philosopher Paul Tillich [posits](https://archive.org/details/couragetobe100till) that when social sensemaking fails to keep up with reality, we experience it as a kind of mass neurosis. Everybody has a crisis of meaning at the same time. Life stops making sense.

We've tried to cope through [[thoughts/Dunbar's Number|Dunbar-scale]] spaces and the [[thoughts/cozy software|cozy web]]

Researcher [Simon DeDeo](https://sites.santafe.edu/~simon/) considers it a phase transition in human culture, dividing history into [three eras](https://twitter.com/sfiscience/status/1552000134963073024):
-   **The premodern/archaic era**, when most information was generated by non-human phenomena like seasons, weather, drought, flood, hail, lightning. “The gods”.
-   **The modern/postmodern era**, when most information was broadcast by a small number of information “sellers”, and consumed by a large number of information “buyers”.
-   **The user-generated content era**, where most information is produced/consumed by users, in a tight feedback loop between attention allocation and content production/consumption.
