Decision rules when the probability of each outcome is known.

Requires an interval scale

When evaluating, we often need to quantify what outcomes are more [[thoughts/value|valuable]] than others
1. Expected Value (EV)
2. Expected Monetary Value (EMV)
3. Expected Utility (EU)

Typically, we use EU. Sometimes we use EMV under the assumption that it is equivalent to EU in a free market (utility is a positive linear transformation of monetary value)

Two arguments for why EU Max:
1. In the long run, no strategy can be expected to do better than maximizing expected utility.
	- Objections
		- There is no long run for humans
		- Gambler's Ruin: a gambler with finite wealth, playing a fair game, eventually goes broke with probability 1
		- How is the long-run argument relevant to unique decisions that can't be repeated?
	- 

## Maximizing Expected Utility
Utility is a numerical representation of the agent’s preference ranking

Generally, we prefer using EU over EMV

Utility theory allows for outcomes without monetary value, or whose value can’t be measured solely in terms of monetary payoff.

### Utility of Money
Note that generally, there is a diminishing marginal utility of money

For example, in a lottery where you win $1M for sure (A) or 50% chance to win $3M and 50% chance to get nothing (B), most people would choose A. The change in utility from $1M to $3M is not enough to offset the drop in probability from certainty to 50%.
