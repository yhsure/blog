## Reboot Discussion
### How did this book start?

-   Why and how did computers go from emblems of cold war state to tools of personal liberation?
-   A bunch of folks like Steward Brand, Kevin Kelly, etc. (inner circle included people from the 60s to the 90s) having a person who he could follow across these generations was extremely helpful

### What is cybernetics?

Different between social networking, computer networking, etc.

Another definition: computationalization of human processes

-   What is the counterculture
    -   What it was lauded for: The hippie world brought us the tech world
    -   What he was trying to say: The tech world of the 40s and 50s brought us the ideas and insights that brought us hippies
-   Insights from the anti-aircraft system
    -   Biological (person) and technological (machine) systems can be described by the same underlying concepts (mathematics)
    -   The core idea: Unifying a world with code. Should be a universal system.
-   War brought different people from different disciplines together and had a shared communication medium of code

### What was the counterculture?

-   People in 50s60s protesting because worried about being turned into information
-   Two distinct movements (both are anti-bureaucracy, anti-big tech, anti-mass culture)
    -   New Left (political)
        -   Struggle
        -   Leaders, Parties
    -   New Communalists (internal consciousness, mindset)
        -   Deeply anchored in the dreams of the cyberneticists
        -   Technocrats of control via communication (banger)
        -   Communes (literally in the name)
-   Why were the 50's kids so enamoured with technology?
    -   Kids of the counterculture
    -   Keep the tech made from the way but throw away the culture of the time
-   When you take away bureaucracy you don't get freedom but 'rule by cool' → disastrous for a democratic society

### Did the New Left have any effect on Cyberculture?

-   Folks on new left will say they did → Computers fulfilled agreement
-   Communalists had more contribution in tech world
-   Communes were disasters, didn't last long, living in California
-   Computer industry was booming
-   Stanford = hotbed of creative LSD ingestion (damn wtf)
    -   reboot group trip when?
-   Steward Brand in 1984 as an Apple Mac, create a society of consciousness
    -   Mac (as a metaphor for tech) is the new LSD → ability to remove the importance of the physical self

### How much of the shift was a result of WEC? How much you see importance of media / social networking vs technical revolution?

-   WEC was not a marketplace, rather an aggregator of information (a pre-Google search engine)
-   What tools do you want to bring to a commune (ex: farming commune)
    -   Food, housing, basics
-   Why would you need a calculator and a book on cybernetics on a farm?
    -   Tools which allow you to fundamentally understand the world in a different way
    -   Appropriation!
-   Catalogue provides the infrastructure → leads to conferences which lead to development of more infrastructure
-   Network Entrepreneur sees several decentralized groups that aren't connected and services as a connector

### Connection between WEC and WELL

-   picture yourself as a hippie in the 1980's, communes will save the world and end warmaking America
    -   California is tech driven, everything is failing
    -   Black panthers have been crushed
-   Howard Rheingold (the virtual community → on wiki someone find it)
-   Electronic Frontier → empty society/land of consciousness
-   Larry Bird, most influential people in silicon valley

### Relations between web3 and p2p tech and cybernetic idea of control through communication

-   TECHNOCRACY what a good word
    -   control of society/industry by a highly technical group of elites
-   Habit of engineering communities to imagine tools as saviours
    -   Narrow actions masking as grandiose political movements
    -   Construction of system that allows for people to pursue profit under the guise of activism, rewards those that come early
-   "The ledger will be honest with us in a way the state never has"

### Our current state seems somewhat inevitable, were there any inflexion points along the way that could have changed the direction

-   Counterculture legitimates a project that is already underway
-   Different in ways that we don't talk about as much
    -   Gone right
        -   The power of email, allows you to have institutional and parainstitutional ties
        -   The power of search, reams of first hand information instantly
    -   Gone wrong
        -   Economics of incentives and bad actors
        -   Individuating users and centralize control of information, enables advertising en masse
            -   Although it predates technology via TV and radio, amplified by
    -   Government have to intervene, like oil companies mining our social world
        -   Must let go of communalist dream of collective consciousness

### How much was it actually counter culture legitimizing it and Steward Brand's use of counterculture language

-   Stanford AI Lab + WEC which helped to legitimize it → described computers as super cool, tools for returning back to the land
-   Created critical convening where they speak each other's language and are able to communicate because of it
-   Politics is bankrupt, new tech, shared consciousness will share us
    -   But a bastardization of war sentiment
    -   Consumerist, high-tech generation

### Era of connected machines → connected humans

-   Enabled by technological development
-   Can this be beneficial for everyone rather than just the privileged?
-   Tech that has been sold to us as devices of personal empowered
    -   not only corporate sponsored but also partnered with the state
    -   intersection of Big Tech and the state is an uh oh → military industrial complex never really goes away

### Where is todays counterculture

-   Not the left, but actually the right
-   Concern is not big data and ML but with corporations and states
-   Place of rebellion is not at the data level but at the institution and union level (in big corporations) + legal level (ex: protection of Uber drivers)
-   There are bodies and factories and server farms → lets not forget the basis of our abstractions

### Would Steward Brand say his work has been coopted?

-   Doesn't like the word 'coopt' → one of his little academic puddles
    -   Cooptation implies an authentic community which is then eaten up by another larger corporati

### What can we learn from the promises/pitfalls of Steward Brand

-   Performative politics
    -   false belief that finding ourselves in our mid 20s is gonna change the world
    -   rather, by engaging and learning from people who are vastly different from us, BE political
    -   don't isolate, break out and do politics
-   don't build communities of consciousness
    -   build places of exchange, places where public decision making and CHANGE happens
