"It is the attempt to discover and formulate a definition, and to follow the implications of that discovery even when they lead in surprisingl, and sometimes disconcerting, directions."


## The Grasshopper
A fun platonic dialogue poised as a tale between insects. The grasshopper, about to die for winter, leaves his disciples with a few riddles. Within these tales, the grashopper details his philosophy of "refusing to work and insisting upon devoting himself exclusively to play". Of course, his disciples challenge him about this, leading to a journey of defining what games are, attitudes toward playing games, and the role of games in utopias. 

## Utopia
"For one cannot help reflecting that if there were no winters to guard against, then the Grasshopper would not get his come-uppance nor the ant his shabby victory. The life of the grasshopper would be vindicated and that of the ant absurd"

## Games
Definitions:
1. "Let us say that games are goal-directed activities in which inefficient means are intentionally chosen."
2. "A game is an activity in which observance of rules is part of the end of the activity, and where such rules are non-ultimate; that is, where other rules can always supersede. the game rules; that is, where the player can always stop playing the game"
3. 

"Rules in games thus seem to be in some sense inseparable from ends, for to break a game rule (a means) is to render impossible the attainment of an end."

"In anything but a game the gratuitous introduction of unnecessary obstacles to the achievement of an end is regarded as a decidedly irrational thing to do, whereas in games it appears to be an absolutely essential thing to do."

## Lusory Attitude -- the game attitude
The element which unifies the other elements into a single formula which successfully states the necessary and sufficient conditions for any activity to be an instance of game playing. The elements of game are
1. The goal
2. The means of achieving the goal
3. The rules
4. The lusory attitude

### Terminology
Prelusory goals: specific achievable state of affairs. They can be described before, or independently of, any game of which it may be, or come to be, a part.
Lusory goals: winning the game. Game specific.
Lusory means: means which are permitted (legal or legitimate) in the attempt to achieve prelusory goals.
Constitutive rules: ruels which prohibit use of the most efficient means for reaching a prelusory goal.

Finally:

Lusory attitude: the acceptance of constitutive rules just so the activity made possible by such acceptance can occur.


## Misc
"You talk as though there wre but two possible alternatives: either a life devoted exclusively to play or a life devoted exclusively to work. But most of us realize that our labour is valuable because it permits us to play, and we are presumably seeking to achieve some kind of balance between work input and play output. People are not, and do not want to be, wholly grasshoppers or wholly ants, but a combination of the two; people are and want to be (if you will forgive a regrettably vulgar but spooneristically inevitable construction) asshoppers or grants. We can, of course, all cease to work, but if we do then we cannot play for long either, for we will shortly die."

"The answer to that argument is that my death is inevitable in any case. Therefore I die or I cease to be the Grasshopper. But since I am just the Grasshopper, no more and no less, dying and ceasing to be the Grasshopper are one and the same thing for me."

"For 'play' we could substitute the expression 'doing things we value for their own sake,' and for 'work' we could substitute the expression 'doing things we value for the sake of something else.'"
