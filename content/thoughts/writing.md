Why write?

Writing as crystallized thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of [[thoughts/knowledge distillation|knowledge distillation]].

It is a form of [[thoughts/bandwidth#Lossiness as Mutation|lossiness as mutation]], a way to re-interpret and adapt the thoughts into a new form -- to breathe it new life. Whether [[posts/networked-thought|networked]] or linear, molding it into new forms through language and [[thoughts/terminology|terminology]] can give it a new perspective. A mental unflattening.

It is the form almost universally understood by all, a sort of [[thoughts/contact language|contact language]] that enables people from vastly different backgrounds and [[thoughts/context|contexts]] to build [[thoughts/fiction#Fiction as shared visions|shared fictions]].

It is the contribution of the radical intellectual, a sort of gift and offering. From David Graeber, ‘Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology’:

> One obvious role for a radical intellectual is to do precisely that: to look at those who are creating viable alternatives, try to figure out what might be the larger implications of what they are (already) doing, and then offer those ideas back, not as prescriptions, but as contributions, possibilities — as gifts [...] Such a project would have to have two aspects: one ethnographic, one utopian, suspended in a [constant dialogue](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation/#old-gifts-anew).
