Why write?

Writing as crystallized thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of [[thoughts/knowledge distillation|knowledge distillation]].

> The thing I like about writing is that it’s quite literally _thinking_—a way for me access my own interiority and construct something from it. What I write is all mine, it’s a living thing, it’s an extension of me that wanders out into the world. (Ava in [How To Avoid Half-Heartedness](https://ava.substack.com/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness))

It is a form of [[thoughts/bandwidth#Lossiness as Mutation|lossiness as mutation]], a way to re-interpret and adapt the thoughts into a new form -- to breathe it new life. Whether [[posts/networked-thought|networked]] or linear, molding it into new forms through [[thoughts/language|language]] and [[thoughts/terminology|terminology]] can give it a new perspective. A mental unflattening.

> What I am doing right now, writing this essay, is, technically, a linear walk through the network of my ideas. That is what writing is: turning a net into a line. (Henrik Karlsson, [Reader-generated Essays](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZtMsyMP5F7zzP8Gvc/reader-generated-essays))

It is the form almost universally understood by all, a sort of [[thoughts/contact language|contact language]] that enables people from vastly different backgrounds and [[thoughts/context|contexts]] to build [[thoughts/fiction#Fiction as shared visions|shared fictions]].

It is the contribution of the radical intellectual, a sort of gift and offering. From David Graeber, ‘Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology’:

> One obvious role for a radical intellectual is to do precisely that: to look at those who are creating viable alternatives, try to figure out what might be the larger implications of what they are (already) doing, and then offer those ideas back, not as prescriptions, but as contributions, possibilities — as gifts [...] Such a project would have to have two aspects: one ethnographic, one utopian, suspended in a [constant dialogue](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation/#old-gifts-anew).

## Art
Writing as [[thoughts/art|art]]

> I write like the 12 dollar desk salad, the bar that packs 20 grams of protein and plastic into one 200-calorie brick. But good writing, like a good meal, needs fat. It should indulge readers, is meant to be chewed and enjoyed, affording a generous escape from the prosaic and mundane. -- [Jasmine Sun](https://jasmine.substack.com/p/audience-of-one)

*How much time should we spend producing great writing, and how much trying to prove it to the world?* Can we write as if we were Hanya Yanagihara in "A Little Life"? To please only ourselves?

## As Thinking
Ted Chiang on the power of written language in *Truth of Fact, Truth of Feeling*:

> Writing was not just a way to record what someone said; it could help you decide what you would say before you said it. And words were not just the pieces of speaking; they were the pieces of thinking. When you wrote them down, you could grasp your thoughts like bricks in your hands and push them into different arrangements. Writing let you look at your thoughts in a way you couldn’t if you were just talking, and having seen them, you could improve them, make them stronger and more elaborate.
