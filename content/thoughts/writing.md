Why write?

Writing as crystallized thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of [[thoughts/knowledge distillation|knowledge distillation]].

It is a form of [[thoughts/bandwidth#Lossiness as Mutation|lossiness as mutation]], a way to re-interpret and adapt the thoughts into a new form -- to breathe it new life. Whether [[posts/networked-thought|networked]] or linear, molding it into new forms through language and [[thoughts/terminology|terminology]] can give it a new perspective. A mental unflattening.

It is the form almost universally understood by all, a sort of [[thoughts/contact language|contact language]] that enables people from vastly different backgrounds and [[thoughts/context|contexts]] to build [[thoughts/fiction#Fiction as shared visions|shared fictions]].

It is the contribution of the radical intellectual, a sort of gift and offering. From David Graeber, ‘Fragments of an Anarchist Anthropology’:

> One obvious role for a radical intellectual is to do precisely that: to look at those who are creating viable alternatives, try to figure out what might be the larger implications of what they are (already) doing, and then offer those ideas back, not as prescriptions, but as contributions, possibilities — as gifts [...] Such a project would have to have two aspects: one ethnographic, one utopian, suspended in a [constant dialogue](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-0/conversation/#old-gifts-anew).

## Creative Writing
### Common misconceptions
- Creative writing is about creating 'literature' and not genre stories: it is more so a question of quality than content
- Writing is an innate talent: writing is a tool that can be honed and practiced
- No real world application for creative writing: almost all conversations, media, arguments, involve some form of convincing the other side! what better way to do that than through story telling
- The riddle of storytelling
	- Imagine two groups of early humans competing for the same resources who lived pretty much the same
	- The first group gossiped and told stories during their leisure time while the second group continued working
	- We know the first group survived because that's us! So why is story telling so evolutionarily beneficial? It's a form of simulation (see also: [[thoughts/consciousness#Behaviourist approaches|behaviourist approaches to consciousness]])

### Classic Story Structures
- Freytag's Pyramid
	- Exposition
	- Rising Action
	- Climax
	- Falling Action
	- Denouement
- Kurt Vonnegut's Shape of Stories
- Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey" (story wheel)
	- Character is in a zone of comfort
	- But they want something
	- They enter an unfamiliar situation
	- Adapt to it
	- Get what they wanted
	- Pay a heavy price for it
	- Then return to their familiar situation
	- Having changed
- Three Act Structure
	- Act I: Get your guy up a tree
	- Act II: Throw rocks at him
	- Act III: Get him outta the tree

### Aspects of Stories
- McGuffin: an object, device, or event that is necessary to the plot and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself.
- The universal grammar for stories: character + conflict = change
- Plot: the how of the story. Explicit. A series of actions, taken by characters, towards their wants, needs or desires
- Theme: the why of the story, the "so what". Should be
	- Universal
	- Specific
	- Implied
- Summary (general information, tell) vs Scene (specific descriptions, show)

### Writing Pitfalls
- Structural ambiguity: missing important story beats (e.g. Four undramatic plot structures) -- you need character, conflict, and change
* Cliché/Familiar phrasing: don't do things that are incredibly overdone
* Awkward exposition: having conversations that characters would never actually have for the sake of reader understanding
* Abstractions: don't invoke abstractions, make it concrete, reify it
- Vagueness (unclear) vs Ambiguity (up to interpretation)
- Deus Ex Machina: god from the machine, heavy handed use of magic or coincidence to solve a conflict
- Characters: be aware of your defaults
	- There not always a person but instead an element of storytelling -- a vehicle on which the action of the story plays out

### Storytelling techniques
- Voice
	- How your characters speak, their voice and diction
	- The language you use as the author
- Irony
	- Verbal irony: the device by which we say one thing and mean another
	- Dramatic irony: the device by which the audience has crucial information that the characters do not
	- Cosmic irony: our understanding of the human condition, in which efforts are thwarted despite our best intentions

### Poetry
- Assonance: repetition of a vowel sound between consonants that may or may not match
- Consonance: repetition of the consonant that concludes a word or syllable
- Alliteration: repetition of an initial consonant sound
- Rhyme
	- True rhyme: both the vowel and consonant of the last accented syllable correspond
	- Internal rhyme: the end of one line rhymes into the beginning or middle of noather
	- Off-rhyme: near-rhyme, slightly discordant or 'not quire there' rhymes (four-inch, door hinge)
- Line: a typographical break representing a slight oral pause or hesitation
	- It adds a kind of emphasis both to the last word of the line and the first of the next line

### Non-fiction
- Journalism
	- Objective, facts only
	- Invisibility of the author
- Literary Journalism
	- Employs literary (storytelling) techniques
	- Has a crafted narrative structure
	- Subjectivity
	- Types
		- Immersion/personal journalism
		- op ed (opinion piece)
		- profile
- Personal Essay
	- Conversational discussion of a topic or idea that the author is interested in
	- Drive by the author's narrative Voice
	- Usually grounded in a personal experience but discusses larger issues more explicitly than other forms
	- Often more Summary than other forms
- Memoir
	- A "story" about an event or aspect of the author's life
	- Reads much the same way a piece of short fiction does
	- Mostly in scene
	- Events are shown through character's actions and interactions playing out in real time
	- Difference with autobiography
		- One event vs an entire life

### Comics
- Reality to Symbol spectrum
- Three Ages of American Comics
	- Golden Age (1930s - 1954):  modern comic books were first published and rapidly increased in popularity. The superhero archetype was created and many well-known characters were introduced
	- Silver Age (1954 - 1970s): the Code restricted many topics from being covered in stories: this prevented certain genres, such as crime and horror comics, from being sold at most comic book shops, and also helped superheroes stay popular and culturally relevant
	- Bronze Age (1970s - 1980s): underground comix movement in response to the restrictions of the Code, and was part of the broader counterculture of the 1960s
- Will Eisner popularized the term graphic novels/sequential art
- Stages of making a comic
	1. Script: lays out story and dialogue, describes each panel in detail
	2. Thumbnails/Roughs: rough sketches that work out the general blocking of panels and page layout
	3. Pencils: refines & finalizes the roughs, works out details & nails down specifics
	4. Inks: finalizes penciles, eliminates unused pencil lines and any excess sketchiness
	5. Colours
	6. Letters: lettering, word balloons, caption boxes, SFX
