### 1 → what is mind design?
-   understand the mind in terms of its design (how its built/works) → a form of cognitive psychology
-   ai would fall under mind design, more about building things and making it work rather than analyzing what already exists
-   psychology by reverse engineering
-   is a materialist → the mind is nothing but matter in motion
    -   ... realize that things can be viewed from different perspectives (or described in different terms) –and, when we look differently, what we are able to see is also different” (p. 2)
    -   For instance, what is a coarse weave of frayed strands when viewed under a microscope is a shiny silk scarf seen in a store window
-   "turing test" and behaviour
    -   turing suggested that intelligence is a matter of behaviour or behavioural capacity
        -   Turing didn't suggest that talking in this way is required to demonstrate intelligence, only that it's sufficient.
        -   Talking is not merely one intelligent ability among others, but also, and essentially, the ability to express intelligently a great many (maybe all) other intelligent abilities.
    -   2 controversies
        -   empirical → will there ever be a computer that wins the imitation game? (passes the turing test)
        -   conceptual → if a computer does win the game, does that mean it can think?
    -   turing believed that both would be achieved
        -   empirical → in about 50 years time (e.g. 2000s), play so well the average interrogator will not have more than 70% chance of making the right identification after 5min
        -   conceptual → if it wins the game, it can think
            -   although believes the question of whether machines can think to be meaningless
    -   descartes believes no to empirical but tentative yes to conceptual
        -   empirical → "they could never use words or other signs arranged in such a manner as is competent to us in order to declare our thoughts to others"
        -   conceptual → "but not that it should arrange them variously so as appositely to reply to what is said in its presence, as men of the lowest grade of intellect can do"
- [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md)
-   original intentionality vs derived intentionality
    -   some things can be "about" others (sentences, stories, etc.)
        -   this is derivative intentionality, only "about" something because the authors "mean" them that day → second-hand intentionality, borrowed from the intentionality that the users already have
    -   can artificial intelligence have intentionality? they seem to be derivative artifacts
        -   derivative intentionality if they don't do anything with what they mean
        -   a person, by contrast, relies on what they believe in to make sensible choices/act efficiently

### 2 → Computers
-   formal system → game in which tokens are manipulated according to definite rules
    -   they are
        -   token manipulation systems
            
            -   can be define through
            
            1.  set of types of formal tokens
            2.  one or more allowable starting positions
            3.  set of formal rules how arrangements can be changed from one to another
        -   digital
            -   characteristic of certain techniques for making things and identifying (reconstructing the meaning) what was made
            -   how good are the later identifications at recovering the prior specifications?
            -   technique is digital if is
                -   positive → reidentification can be perfect
                -   reliable → almost always is perfect
        -   medium independent
            -   doesn't matter how tokens are represented
            -   e.g. chess, pieces can be made from wood, plastic, glass
            -   but lighting something on fire isnt (only certain things can be lit on fire)
    -   as a result, all formal systems are self-contained
-   automatic formal systems
    
    -   physical formal system that moves by itself
    
    1.  some configuration of its parts/states can be regarded as tokens and positions of a formal system
    2.  in normal operation, the machine can manipulate the tokens in accord with the rules of that system
-   universality → using one automatic formal system to implement another
    -   this is literally programming
    -   write a program for a "general purpose" computer and make it act exactly as it were the special computer that you need
    -   thus, every ordinary (programming) computer is a universal machine in Turing's sense → turing completeness
-   algorithms →procedures that are sure to succeed in a finite time frame
-   heuristics → procedures that, while not guaranteed to give the right answer every time, are fairly reliable most of the time
-   different of algorithm vs heuristic is again a matter of perspective
    -   e.g. chess playing algorithm, brute force is impractical so you bake in some heuristics into the procedure to evaluate how "good" a move is
    -   each step is technically just counting up the number of pieces and what kind they are → can be considered an algorithm
    -   but on the grand scale of the chess game, those moves may not be perfect → heuristic
-   digitization
    -   pictures are not digital → they are digitized
        -   cant recreate the real thing from a picture
    -   divided into enough dots and gradations that the increments are barely perceptible but they are distinct none the less
-   computers and intelligence
    -   in turing test, only relevant inputs/ouputs were words — which are all formal tokens
    -   turing had shown that any formal input/output function from a very broad category could be implemented in a universal machine, provided it had enough speed and memory
        -   turing did not (and could not) show that human verbal input/output falls under the category of things that can be implemented in a universal machine
