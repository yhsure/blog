Emptiness is like the mathematical concept of 0.
- It seems to have no value, yet is it the foundation of mathematics.
- Without 0, you cannot have 1, 2, 3, so forth.

Emptiness thus does not mean nothingness (0 is not null), emptiness is the base case through which existence is meaningful.

Emptiness means empty of independent existence
- Dependent Existence: for a flower to exist and for us to have experienced it requires the existence of many others. The gardener, the sun, the water, the minerals, the soil.
	- In cognitive science, concept of [connectionist representation](thoughts/representation.md)
	- In [emergent systems](thoughts/emergent%20behaviour.md), there is no 'conductor' there is only a symphony that interdepend on each other
- Independent Existence: a separate existence. A flower cannot be by herself or have a self-nature (svabhƒÅva).

Thus, form is emptiness but emptiness is form (existence is to depend on others).
