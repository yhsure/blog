## Threefold model of [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md)[^1]
Different brain-body processes

1. Awareness: specific to global levels of awareness
2. Contents of awareness: specific to consciousness of an object in a given sense field
3. Identification: sense of [the Self](thoughts/the%20Self.md)

## Hypnagogic State[^1]
State of leading into sleep

- See images and hear sounds and strange associative thoughts
- Sleep Stages
	- Relaxed Wakefulness
	- Stage N1 (Hypnagogic)
	- Stage N2
	- Stage N3 (Deep Sleep)
	- REM (Dreaming Sleep)
		- Associated with vivid sensory dreams
- Dissolution of boundaries between self and not-self
	- Not strong sense of being immersed in a world
- We look *at* patterns and they absorb us

## Dream State[^1]
Immersion in a dream

> Dreams
> Here we are all, by day; by night, we're hurled
> By dreams, each one into a several [separate] world
> -- Robert Herrick (1591 - 1674)

- Sense of being in a world
- We experience being *in* the dream
- Two ways of experience
	- Identification with dream ego from first-person (field perspective)
	- Identification with dream ego from third-person (observer perspective)
- Wa cannot inspect (nonlucid) dreams directly
	- We can inspect only our waking memories of dreams
	- We have certain cultural and linguistic practices of dream reporting whereby we make stories of our dreams ([linguistic relativism](thoughts/linguistic%20relativism.md) for dreams)

### Different views (Simulation Models of Dreaming)
1. Orthodox View
	- Precepts: dreaming involves senses that we experience when we are waking, except the experiences of things that are not there or have weak correlation with what is there
	- Beliefs: when we dream $p$ we believe $p$ to be true. In most cases, these are false so dreaming involves mainly false beliefs
2. Hallucination model
	- Dreaming is immersive spatiotemporal hallucination
	- Immersive: full immersion in the dream world
	- Spatiotemporal: full immersion in a here and now
	- Hallucination: experience that seems exactly like a perception but has weak stimulus correlation with the environment
3. Imagination model
	- Dreaming involves experiences of the sort we have when we imagine (mental images)
	- When we dream that $p$, we imagine that $p$ (however, imagining that $p$ does not entail believing that $p$)
	- Dreams can be indeterminate in their sensory features (e.g. indeterminate in colour)
	- Object: what about emotions? Some emotions can only arise from belief
		1. When I dream that $p$, I experience fear, elation, etc.
		2. Such emotions arising from an attitude that $p$ can only arise from a belief that $p$
		3. So when I dream that $p$, I believe that $p$
	- Counterargument: contradiction, you still feel these emotion reading fiction
		- Same premises as above, but final conclusion is that: when I read in a fiction that $p$, I do NOT believe that $p$.
		- Way out of this contradiction is to deny premise 2)
	- Eye movements during lucid-REM sleep resemble waking perception more than they resemble waking imagination
	- Upshot: to dream is to imagine a dream world and to identify with the dream ego immersed in that world

## Mind-wandering and Dreaming[^1]
- Similarities
	- Content
		- Largely audiovisual and emotional
		- Loose narratives tinged with fantasy
		- Strongly related to current concerns
		- Draws on long-term memory
		- Simulates social interactions
		- Involves identification with a mental images of [the self](thoughts/the%20Self.md)
	- Process
		- Mostly unguided (save for lucid)
		- (hyper)associative
	- Lack of meta-awareness (awareness of the current contents of consciousness)
	- Large overlaps in activation patterns of cortical regions

## Lucid Dreaming[^1]
- A dream in which you can direct your attention to the dreamlike quality of the state
- Features
	- Greater clarity/vividness
	- Realism
	- Emotional exhilaration
	- Sense of freedom
- Sense of self in lucid dream state
	- Self-as-dreamer: "I am dreaming" (knowledge of being asleep in bed)
	- Self-as-dreamed (dream ego): "I am flying" (default conceptualizations of self)
- Is lucid dreaming knowing you're dreaming or dreaming you're dreaming?
	- Did they just dream that they were aware that they were dreaming?
	- Knowing you're dreaming seems to involve a certain kind of attention and cognitive control that is missing when you dream you're dreaming
	- Seems to be a tell-tale LRLR eye moment signal during REM sleep when participants realize they are dreaming

## Sleep Maps[^1]
- Neuroscience
	- Presence of conciousness (waking, dreaming) vs
	- Absence of consciousness (dreamless sleep, coma)
- Indian yogic philosophies
	- Gross consciousness (waking, dreaming)
	- Subtle consciousness (dreamless sleep)

Are sleep states conscious?
1. Yes: Yoga, Advaita Dedānta, Buddhism
	1. Dreamless sleep is a kind of consciousness without an object
	2. Invoked to explain the continuity of consciousness and sense of self across waking and sleeping
	3. Invoked to explain the waking knowledge of having been asleep
3. No: [Nyāya](thoughts/Nyāya.md)
	1. Concept of sleep is based off of inference
