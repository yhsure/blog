Robert Kegan’s model of adult development, basically a series of increasingly sophisticated ways one can approach ethical reasoning.

Four orders of [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md)
1. Stage 1 (Self)
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: perceptions (fantasy, what I want to see)
		- Interpersonal: social perceptions (what do people expect me to do)
		- Intrapersonal: impulses (what do I want)
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: movement
		- Impulses: sensation
	- Underlying structure: Single point/immediate/atomistic
		- ![](thoughts/images/Kegan%20Stage%201.png)
1. Stage 2 (Communal)
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: concrete (what is true), data, cause-and-effect
		- Interpersonal: point of view (role-concept, simple reciprocity)
		- Intrapersonal: needs, preferences, self-concept
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: perceptions
		- Interpersonal: social perceptions
		- Intrapersonal: impulses
	- Underlying structure: Durable Category

1. Stage 3 (Systematic)
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: Abstractions (ideality, inference, generalization, hypothesis, ideals, values)
		- Interpersonal: Mutuality/Interpersonalism (role-consciousness, mutual reciprocity)
		- Intrapersonal: Inner States (subjectivity, self-consciousness)
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: concrete
		- Interpersonal: point of view
		- Intrapersonal: enduring dispositions, needs, preferences
	- Underlying structure: Cross-categorical/Trans-categorical
		- ![](thoughts/images/Kegan%20Stage%203.png)
1. Stage 4 (Fluid)
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: Abstract systems (idealogy, formulation, authorization, relations between abstractions)
		- Interpersonal: Institution (relationship-regulating forms, multiple-role consciousness)
		- Intrapersonal: Self-authorship (self-regulation, self-formation, identity, autonomy, individuation)
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: abstractions
		- Interpersonal: mutuality, interpersonalism
		- Intrapersonal: inner states, subjectivity, self-consciousness
	- Underlying structure: System/Complex

## Stages of Adult Development
### Self
- the subject (self) is a collection of short-term practical interests
- ethics in this mode is “instrumental”: aimed at satisfying your own needs, while working with or around other people’s. Relationships are “transactional”: transient alliances for mutual benefit.
### Communal
- no longer a collection of interests but you *have* interests
- you are *in* relationships and find yourself defined by them
- the other’s point of view matters to us intrinsically, not just extrinsically as a means of satisfying our more egocentric purposes -- one gains the ability to put oneself in the other person's shoes
- stage 3’s limitation is that it cannot resolve conflicts between responsibilities to different relationships. If one person wants you to do something, and another person wants you to do something different, there is no good basis for decision
- it’s impossible to base a large-scale society on the communal mode, because it’s so ineffective at coordinating complex group activities. (If individuals frequently fail to do their specific, agreed tasks, nothing can get done.) Modern societies are based on the systematic mode -- see [group limits](thoughts/group%20limits.md) and [social contracts](thoughts/social%20contracts.md)
### Systematic
- you no longer are in relationships that define you; you have relationships
- you are “self-authored”: you choose your own principles, projects, and commitments
- it means seeing the other person for who they really are. Emotions are just something people have, from time to time. Those need to be dealt with, but should not be taken too seriously. Relating to the other person’s principles, projects, and commitments means supporting what they most care about in the longer run
### Fluid
- systems are relativized. They move from subject to object, and are subordinated to, and organized by, the process of meaning-making itself
- you are no longer defined as a system of principles, projects, and commitments. You have several such systems, “multiple selves,” none of them entirely coherent, and which have different values—and this is no longer a problem, because you respect all of them
- there is sometimes an uncomfortable middle between systematic (stage 4) and fluid (stage 5) stages often referred to as stage 4.5 where nihilism and postmodernism commonly emerges. Understanding that there is no ultimate meaning, one comes to the wrong conclusion that there are no meanings at all
- sees systems as nebulous (intangible, interpenetrating, transient, amorphous, and ambiguous) and patterned (reliable, distinct, enduring, clear, and definite)

An example:
- Self: you show up to work on time because if you don’t, you might be fired, and then you’d have to find another job, which would be a hassle, and you’d lose pay in the meantime. If you do show up, you’ll eventually be promoted, so you’ll get paid more.
- Communal: you show up to work on time because your coworkers would be upset with you if you were late; or because your spouse would be upset with you if you got fired; or because you might miss a pay raise that would mean a better quality of life for your children.
- Systematic: you show up to work on time because that’s your job.
