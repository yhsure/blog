Robert Keganâ€™s model of adult development, basically a series of increasingly sophisticated ways one can approach ethical reasoning.

Four orders of [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md)
1. Stage 1
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: perceptions (fantasy, what I want to see)
		- Interpersonal: social perceptions (what do people expect me to do)
		- Intrapersonal: impulses (what do I want)
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: movement
		- Impulses: sensation
	- Underlying structure: Single point/immediate/atomistic

1. Stage 2
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: concrete (what is true), data, cause-and-effect
		- Interpersonal: point of view (role-concept, simple reciprocity)
		- Intrapersonal: needs, preferences, self-concept
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: perceptions
		- Interpersonal: social perceptions
		- Intrapersonal: impulses
	- Underlying structure: Durable Category

1. Stage 3
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: Abstractions (ideality, inference, generalization, hypothesis, ideals, values)
		- Interpersonal: Mutuality/Interpersonalism (role-consciousness, mutual reciprocity)
		- Intrapersonal: Inner States (subjectivity, self-consciousness)
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: concrete
		- Interpersonal: point of view
		- Intrapersonal: enduring dispositions, needs, preferences
	- Underlying structure: Cross-categorical/Trans-categorical
		- ![](thoughts/images/Kegan%20Stage%203.png)
1. Stage 4
	- Subject:
		- Cognitive: Abstract systems (idealogy, formulation, authorization, relations between abstractions)
		- Interpersonal: Institution (relationship-regulating forms, multiple-role consciousness)
		- Intrapersonal: Self-authorship (self-regulation, self-formation, identity, autonomy, individuation)
	- Object:
		- Cognitive: abstractions
		- Interpersonal: mutuality, interpersonalism
		- Intrapersonal: inner states, subjectivity, self-consciousness
	- Underlying structure: System/Complex
