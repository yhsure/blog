# Crane
## Language of thought hypothesis → LOTH
- proposes thinking occurs in a mental language, this is called mentalese
    -   computations in a classical way
    -   classical computational architecture distinguishes between data-structures and rules/programs which operate on said structures
    -   sequential processing rather than parallel
    -   'rules and representations picture' sometimes called GOFAI
-   neural networks or connectionist computational models challenges any argument for mentalese
    -   architecture
        -   large number of units which are connected to others (connectionism) and the connections have different strengths (weights)
        -   units are arranged in layers
        -   computation happens in parallel
    -   like in a classical machine, [representations](/thoughts/representation) are assigned to connectionist networks by the people who build them
    -   two types of connectionist representation
        -   localist → each unit is assigned a feature as a whole that represents
        -   distributed → state of the network as a whole represents something
            -   often claimed to be one of the distinctive features of connectionism
            -   connectionist networks is sometimes called parallel distributed processing (PDP)
    -   can be trained to learn
    -   resemble the structure of the brain much more closely than any classical computer
        -   really good at pattern recognition

# Putnam
## Turing Test
-   dialogic test of competence
-   exploring the notion of reference
-   are the things the machine refers to the same things we refer to?
	-   e.g. when talking about steak, are we talking about the same steak?
	-   the machine doesn't have any real input into the world, no sense organs
		-   It is true that the machine can discourse beautifully about, say, the scenery in New England. But it could not recognize an apple tree or an apple, a mountain or a cow, a field or a steeple, if it were in front of one
