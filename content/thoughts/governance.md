## Community Governance
-   bottom-up emergent properties vs top-down governance
-   homeostasis of communities
    -   mix of internal and external influence
    -   secluded vs public: [digital commons](thoughts/digital%20commons.md)
    -   conforming to labels
    -   self-fulfilling prophecies
-   sanctity of natural interactions
    -   monetizing human interaction (ondeck)
    -   how do we screen for value alignment?
        -   interviews? (two-way vibe check)
        -   publishing list of values
        -   why introductions are hard: [introductions](/thoughts/introductions)
            -   can never fully/properly frame yourself
