re: [digital mindfulness](thoughts/digital%20mindfulness.md)! Not everything needs to be built at scale -- sometimes it can just be for family and friends :)) Normalize creating playful and non-[instrumental](thoughts/instrumentalism.md) technology

## An app can be a home-cooked meal

Clay Shirky: “Situated software, by contrast, doesn’t need to be personalized — it is personal from its inception.”

I can, at this point, make the things happen on computers that I want to make happen. At the same time, I would not last a day as a professional software engineer. Leave me in charge of a critical database and you will return to a smoldering crater.

I am the programming equivalent of a home cook.

## Personal Software
### Spring '83

I love the disclaimer at the top: "It’s okay to share this link, but I want to underscore that I am sending it specifically to you with the hope that you will … really think about it! At such a primordial stage, a proposal like this doesn’t need diffuse, drive-by attention. It needs, instead, close consideration and generous imagination."

- "There are no analytics, obviously. Nothing is counted. Boards can’t load tracking pixels, and they can’t ping remote analytics APIs. Sorry, folks … you’ve got to let go of the numbers. In 2022, they are not helpful feedback, but rather a clear warning you are in the wrong place."
- When you operate a server, you get a universe for free (see also: [[thoughts/World Building#World Seed|world seed]]).

> fuck responsive layouts, all my homies hate responsive layouts

- There’s unexpected energy in the space of “being able to lay out elements visually on a 2d plane and know that the browser isn’t going to wrap them somewhere you didn’t mean”.

## Handmade Web
From J.R. Carpenter's [*A Handmade Web*](http://luckysoap.com/statements/handmadeweb.html)

> I evoke the term 'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or [[thoughts/identity|identity]].
