What even does primary mean in this context?

## Horizon Metaphor
> The existential primacy of consciousness: consciousness in the horizonal sense is not something we have; it's something we *live*

Two conceptions
1. The horizon is real: it is the farthest point the eye can see before the Earth's surface curves away beneath our view
2. The horizon is ideal: it is a structure of perception but not something that actually exists independent of perception

The horizon is a phenomenal structure of consciousness, not a particular phenomenal property (quale) or phenomenal content. Both [qualia](thoughts/qualia.md) and other phenomenal contents always appear from within the horizon of consciousness.

Consciousness then in the horizonal sense is not something we 'have', it is something we live in. There is no way to step outside consciousness and measure it against something else because inside the horizon is all we know

The horizon itself is [empty](thoughts/emptiness.md).

Kant defines 'transcendental knowledge' as knowledge which is occupied not so much with objects as with the mode of our knowledge of objects in so far as this mode of knowledge is to be possible *a priori*. Consciousness then is not another object of knowledge, but that by which any object is knowable -- consciousness is irreducible to the domain of objects.

### Two conceptions on the world and the universe
Define the life-world as the space of meaning within which anything is intelligible and thinkable

1. Natural Science: the universe contains the life-world
2. Philosophy: the life-world contains the universe; the universe is always disclosed to us from within the life-world

## The Blind Spot
Adam Frank, Marcelo Gleiser, Evan Thompson in *Aeon*

Scientific materialists will argue that the scientific method enables us to get outside of experience and grasp the world as it is in itself. But experience is present at every step. Scientific models must be pulled out from observations, often mediated by our complex scientific equipment. They are idealisations, not actual things in the world.

"In principle, it is absurd to think that we can explain consciousness by reducing it to certain objects of science, since these objects are abstract relational structures extracted from the life-world of lived experience" (Husserl)

Quantum-Bayesianism (QBism) combines quantum information theory and Bayesian probability theory. It interprets the irreducible probabilities of a quantum state not as an element of reality, but *as the degrees of belief an agent has about the outcome of a measurement*. In other words, making a measurement is like making a bet on the world’s behaviour, and once the measurement is made, updating one’s knowledge.

Advocates of this interpretation sometimes describe it as ‘participatory realism’, because human agency is woven into the process of doing physics as a means of gaining knowledge about the world. From this viewpoint, the equations of quantum physics don’t refer just to the observed atom but also to the observer and the atom taken as a whole in a kind of ‘observer-participancy’

The upshot: there is no simple way to remove our experience as scientists from the characterization of the physical world. Observing it doesn't only affect the measurement, observing it *is* the measurement

Scientific knowledge then is a self-correcting narrative made from the world and our experience of it evolving together (see [[thoughts/philosophy of science|Karl Popper's Philosophy of Science]])
