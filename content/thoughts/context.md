Content only has meaning if it has context. Content thus must be empty of independent origination (it cannot exist on its own, see also: [[thoughts/emptiness]]).

## Context in writing
Footnotes and marginalia are layers of context on top of the original media. These annotations situate the original media in new contexts.

## Context of Data
For most data in web2, the application *is the context*. How do we make data as first class citizens?

Does [[thoughts/interoperability|interoperable]] data mean context-free data? I don't think so. I think [[thoughts/interoperability|interoperable]] data is data that can be *translated* across contexts
