Interesting approach to taking a negative-space approach to defining values: the *negation* of what destroys value is then what must give it value.

I'm not sure I fully agree, I don't think values follow the contrapositive (e.g. A implies B is true does NOT necessarily mean that not A implies not B)

### Shared [truth](thoughts/truth.md)
Creating shared truth *through [fiction](thoughts/fiction.md)* by dreaming the world we want to see come to fruition. I really like this, helps to explain why we need a collective vision. Reminds me of a big reason [contests like this exist](https://medium.com/@yishan/solarpunk-art-contest-2021-da9474c9722e).

In essence, these are just [social contracts](thoughts/social-contracts.md) (which are just shared truths that we all believe in)

Legal fiction is one that has huge influence today (enforced by the threat of violence which relies on the asymmetric power of a nation state). But it feels like we can create other fictions that we as a society can believe in (e.g. the mathematical [consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) fiction)

Unfortunately, social capacity of humans mean we hit the [group limit](thoughts/group-limits.md) of ~150 people pretty quickly. Thus, writing and thene the shared record was invented to hold societies larger than a single tribe together.

"Because blockchains allow us to define succinctly our shared truths, **and because the record itself is shared** across all participants, there is a whole new "trust space" we can explore, searching for more valuable kinds of transactions impossible within merely legal fictions."
