> Scientific and technical work is made invisible by its own success. When a machine runs efficiently, one need only to focus on its inputs and ouputs and not on its internal complexity. Thus, paradoxically, the more science and technology succeed, the more opaque and obscure they become

In the context of systems, actors are anyone, human or nonhuman, who engages in intentional action shaped by internalized expectations of how it will be perceived

If we start to disect the black box and understand that it
- is made by people
- substitutes their actions
- is a permanent delegate of the work
- shapes human action by prescribing what sorts of people can pass through it

Then this is called "opening the black box" or "infrastructural inversion" for larger scale infrastructures

Jim Johnson: building and rebuilding walls everytime you use it is a waste, thats why we have doors as *[infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md)* that saves a lot of this repetitive work.
