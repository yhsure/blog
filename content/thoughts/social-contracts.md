Social contracts are implicit agreements among members of social  groups to cooperate for social benefits. They help us form shared cultures and values

[Rousseau](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rousseau/) -> everyone forfeits some rights so that they might also impose selected duties

e.g. most democracies today, citizens agree to pay taxes in their shared currencies to fund and maintain basic [infrastructure](thoughts/infrastructure.md) like roads, bridges, and electrical grids
