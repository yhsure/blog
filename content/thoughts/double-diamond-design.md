Two main 'diamonds' of diverge-converge, one to find the right problem and the other to find the right solution (fulfilling human needs).

The 4 basic activities for interaction design are as follows:
1. Discovering requirements (discover/define phase). Deciding what to design is key, and exploring the problem space is one way to decide. The goal is understanding the target users and the support an interactive product could provide.
2. Designing alternatives (develop phase). This can be 2 parts, conceptual design (producing the ocnceptual model of the product) or concrete design (detail of the product like colours, sounds, images, etc.)
3. Prototyping alternative designs to be communicated and assessed (develop phase). The process of designing behaviour of interactive products as well as look and feel. Doesn't necessarily need working software!
4. Evaluating the product and the UX it ofers (develop phase). Determine the usability and acceptability of the product or design measured in terms of a varierty of usability and user-experience criteria.
