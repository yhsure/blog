> A _collection_ is a group of resources that have been selected for some purpose.

Resource-type: a novel, biography, etc. (ordering on the type of artefact)
Resource-kind: coin collection, stamp collection, etc. (ordering on the medium of artefact)

A collection itself can also be a resource. An index is a description resource that contains information about the location and frequencies of terms in a collection to enable more efficient search.

What then is a library? According to Glushko, they are [organizing systems](thoughts/organizing-systems.md) which "select, collect, organize, conserve, preserve, and provide access to information on behalf of a community of users."

### Libraries
[Source](https://placesjournal.org/article/fugitive-libraries)

Libraries are not universally welcoming spaces. At least 87% of librarians are white, and stories of discrimination/hostility for their race/class/sexual identity/disability are not uncommon. There is a lot of reinforcement of outdated values embedded in classification.

There is a concept called "double-consciousness" which is essentially the "sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity" especially felt by minorities. Historical library practices can shape contemporary technologies.

How neutral should libraries be? Historically, neutrality has been a core value for a lot of librarians, but has often been used to justify "disengagement from crises in urban communities."

Undercommons: a place allowing for "ongoing experiment" with informal ways of learning together, of building futures together

Fugitivity then, is the mode of being other than settled, especially recognizing that there are spaces and modalities that exist separate from the logical, the logistical, the housed and the positioned.
