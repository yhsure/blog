-  intentionality is derived
-  [Chinese room argument](thoughts/Chinese%20room%20argument.md) example tries to show that even programming something with intentionality (a person) with a format program, that formal program carries no additional intentionality
-   How does intention change with time? Are my intentions in the past just as valid as my current intentions? ([source](https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-3/intention/))
	-   Smart contracts and blockchains try to permanently embed and codiy intentionality
	-   But, intentionality doesn't mean you can't change though. People aren't permanent, thoughts aren't permanent. Why should we try to make them so?

## Dennet
-   Based off of repeated behaviour rather than internal mechanisms
-   This accepts [Brentano](thoughts/Brentano's%20Thesis.md)'s definition of the mental, but proposed materialist way to view intentionality (and intelligence)
    1.  behaviour should be understood not in isolation but in context and as part of a consistent pattern of behaviour (holism)
    2.  consistent pattern of behaviour in context can be construed as rational (interpretation)
        1.  rational â†’ acting so as to best satisfy your goals given what you know and can tell about your situation
### Rabbit example
-   We infer that a rabbit can tell a fox from another rabbit, always wanting to get away from the one but not the other
-   Thus, on a given occasion, we attribute to the rabbit intentional states (beliefs and desires) about a particular fox, on the basis not only of its current behaviour but also of the pattern in its behaviour over time.
