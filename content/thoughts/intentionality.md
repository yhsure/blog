-   intentionality is derived
-   [Chinese room](thoughts/intelligence.md) example tries to show that even programming something with intentionality (a person) with a format program, that formal program carries no additional intentionality

## Dennet
-   based off of behaviour rather than internal mechanisms
-   accepts Brentano's definition of the mental, but proposed materialist way to view intentionality (and intelligence)
    1.  behaviour should be understood not in isolation but in context and as part of a consistent pattern of behaviour (holism)
    2.  consistent pattern of behaviour in context can be construed as rational (interpretation)
        1.  rational → acting so as to best satisfy your goals given what you know and can tell about your situation
-   rabbit example
    -   We infer that a rabbit can tell a fox from another rabbit, always wanting to get away from the one but not the other
    -   Thus, on a given occasion, we attribute to the rabbit intentional states (beliefs and desires) about a particular fox, on the basis not only of its current behavior but also of the pattern in its behavior over time.

## Crane
- representational character of states of mind
-   mental states which exhibit intentionality are called intentional states
-   to say thoughts are intentional states is to say that they must have content (an intentional object)
-   brentano's thesis → intentionality is the mark of the mental
	-   all mental phenomena exhibit intentionality
		-   rephrased: is mentality sufficient for intentionality?
		-   what about pain, feelings, moods
			-   can be accounted for
			-   physical pain → can have a place, the felt location can cause a plausible difference in intentionality (what the mental state is directed at)
			-   depression → may seem to be general, but can be characterized as overall "world suck" but the world is still a subject
	-   only mental phenomena exhibit intentionality
		-   rephrased: is mentality necessary for intentionality?
		-   are minds the only things that have intentionality? to prove wrong, we need to find something with intentionality that doesn't have a mind
		-   what about words / pictures / maps?
			-   these only exhibit derived intentionality
			-   interpreted rather than having intrinsic intentionality
