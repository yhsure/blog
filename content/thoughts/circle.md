## On the definition of [play](thoughts/play.md)
> How does your own intuitive conception of "play" or "playfulness" relate to Suit's idea of "games" and Odell's idea of "doing nothing"? Are they different kinds of things? Are they similar kinds of things with important differences? Some other relationship?

what comes to mind when i think of play?


## Reflections
have not been this excited about meeting people at 9am on a monday, ever

things we've talked about
- why labels are important
- can play produce products
- creating spaces of abundance
