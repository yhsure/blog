[An attempt](posts/play.md) to answer the prompt:

> How does your own intuitive conception of "play" or "playfulness" relate to Suit's idea of "games" and Odell's idea of "doing nothing"? Are they different kinds of things? Are they similar kinds of things with important differences? Some other relationship?

## Reflections
I did not think I would ever be this excited about meeting people at 9AM on a Monday ever. This Circle has helped me center myself in what I truly find energizing in this world: discussing cool ideas with cool people.

This is a sort of meta-reflection on choosing to lead this Circle.

### Leadership + People


### Topics
things we've talked about
- why labels are important
- can play produce products
- creating spaces of abundance
