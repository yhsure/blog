For [trust](thoughts/trust.md) to evolve:
1. Repeat interactions must happen. Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future interactions *before* trust can evolve
2. Possible win-win situations. This must be a non-zero-sum game where *both* players can be better off
3. Low miscommunication. High-tolerance players are possible but if the level of miscommunication is too high (low signal to noise ratio), trust breaks down. Even in low miscommunication situations, it pays to be more forgiving

In the short run, the rules of the game define what the players do. In the long run, players define the rules. Incentive for us to build the environment and rules we want to play in.

Unfortunately, modern day social media means we have less 'close-friends' and thus repeat interactions than ever. With algorithmic news feeds, miscommunication breeds and win-win situations become scarce.
