## Cancel culture and healthy debate
i think being inclusive and mindful of the opinions is really important
but there also needs to be a balance between the weight of creating an unsafe place for ideas vs unsafe places for people

where we're trying to communicate in ways that allows for difficult conversations and also at the same time doesn't result in the silencing of voices

"don't make sweeping statements against core identity groups"
core identity groups -> race, religion, sex, gender, nationality, etc.

should ideas be treated as separate from the people who proposed them?
logically, ideas should be evaluated from the merit of the idea itself
yet, there are cases when other contextual information is important
* e.g., when talking about diversity issues, talking from first-hand exp is often a lot more valid than second-hand or third-hand
* in these cases, does methodology and original source of speaker count as *part* of the idea?
