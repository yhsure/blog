'Broken world thinking' -> focus on constant process of entropy and undoing of work and what we can do to slow/halt this process rather than introducing new things. Curious how this relates to [climate tech](thoughts/climate%20tech.md) and general escapist vibes of people like Elon wanting to escape to space rather than fixing problems with our current world.
