# Crane
## Symbolic Representation
-   mans just kinda doesn't agree w/ the pioneer 10 space probe plate lmao
    -   symbols will not mean anything to any alien life
    -   we find it easy to understand because we have the context and we live on this planet
-   words do not have meaning in and of themselves (no intrinsic meaning)
-   what sort of things can be representations
    -   words/pictures/numbers/diagrams
    -   state of mind, can represent almost anything at all
-   what sort of things can be objects of representations
    -   almost anything (physical objects, sentences, numbers, moods, feelings, emotions, non-existent things)
    -   pictures represent by resemblance → derivative intention
        -   ‘resemblance theory of pictorial representation’, or the 'resemblance theory'
        -   WC ant argument, resemblance is not enough for reference
-   X represents Y → suggests that representation is a relation between two things
-   is there a basic type of representation underlying everything else?
    -   crane says mental representations are the most basic level
    -   pictures dont work
        -   represent by resemblance
        -   When we try to represent the difference between … and …, if … then …, and either … or … in pictures, we draw a complete blank. There just seems no way of doing it.
    -   words don't work either
        -   represent by convention
        -   same words in same context mean the same thing to different people
    -   all other kinds of representation all depend on mental representations in order to work
        -   many things that we take for granted cannot be represented in terms of pictures → e.g. relations between ideas like "if it doesn't rain this afternoon, we will go for a walk"
-   aside
    -   A is necessary for B → B is true only if A is true
    -   A is sufficient for B → if A is true, B is true
    -   A is necessary + sufficient for B → A is true if and only if B is true
## Mental Representation
-   crane believes that all thoughts must have a content
-   state of mind = mental state → something like a belief, a desire, a hope, a wish, a fear, a hunch, an expectation, an intention, a perception
-   must all be directed at something
-   thought → a state of mind which represents the world or an aspect of the world (representational mental state)
-   two aspects to thoughts
    -   attitude → belief/hope/expectation/etc.
    -   situation → visit budapest
-   A $\phi$s that S → Charles (A) believes ($\phi$s) that pigs can swim (S)
    -   propositional attitudes → thoughts of this form
-   content of a mental state → what distinguishes states involving the same attitude from one another
-   on [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md), conscious thoughts vs unconscious thoughts
    -   not all thoughts are conscious thoughts
    -   thoughts you are aware of having
    -   it is possible to believe or desire things you don't know that you believe or desire
    -   descartes denies that there are unconscious thoughts
    -   freud agrees there are unconscious thoughts (and desires)

## Intentionality
- representational character of states of mind
-   mental states which exhibit intentionality are called intentional states
-   to say thoughts are intentional states is to say that they must have content (an intentional object)
-   brentano's thesis → intentionality is the mark of the mental
	-   all mental phenomena exhibit intentionality
		-   rephrased: is mentality sufficient for intentionality?
		-   what about pain, feelings, moods
			-   can be accounted for
			-   physical pain → can have a place, the felt location can cause a plausible difference in intentionality (what the mental state is directed at)
			-   depression → may seem to be general, but can be characterized as overall "world suck" but the world is still a subject
	-   only mental phenomena exhibit intentionality
		-   rephrased: is mentality necessary for intentionality?
		-   are minds the only things that have intentionality? to prove wrong, we need to find something with intentionality that doesn't have a mind
		-   what about words / pictures / maps?
			-   these only exhibit derived intentionality
			-   interpreted rather than having intrinsic intentionality

# Putnam
## Ant argument
-   The ant who traces a line that ends up looking like a caricature of Winston Churchill. Is it a picture or representation of him?
-   resemblance is not necessary nor sufficient for representation
	-   not sufficient → A can resemble B even if it fails to represent B
	-   not necessary → A can represent B even if A fails to resemble B
-   do we need intention?
-   how do you have a thought _about_ something?
    -   the problem of intentionality
    -   "No physical object can, in itself, refer to one thing rather than to another; nevertheless, thoughts in the mind obviously do succeed in referring to one thing rather than another. So thoughts (and hence the mind) are of an essentially different nature than physical objects"
-   words and pictures aren't inherently _about_ something, that meaning is added via our own attitudes
    -   if so, what do our attitudes depend on?
-   what does matter for representation is some sort of causal link back to the [original thing](thoughts/originality.md)
    -   X caused Y to do Z
## Brain in a Vat
- Related to [virtual-worlds](/thoughts/virtual-worlds)
-   we all live in a "collective hallucination", i believe you exist and i can tell you thinks and hear things from you
-   could we say/think/believe that we are brains in a vat?
-   putnam states that this argument is false as it is self-refuting
	1.  Assume we are brains in a vat
	2.  If we are brains in a vat, then “brain” does not refer to brain, and “vat” does not refer to vat (via CC)
	3.  If “brain in a vat” does not refer to brains in a vat, then “we are brains in a vat” is false
	4.  Thus, if we are brains in a vat, then the sentence “We are brains in a vat” is false (1,2,3)
-   are the things that BIVs refer to the same things that we as real people refer to?

# Dretske
-   mental representations
    -   naturalistic → matter of correlation, "these spots mean measles", spots are a reliable indicator of measles
    -   teach us about the term, they appeal to natural laws and science
    -   conceptual → "this read light means stop", matter of convention, connection is arbitrary
    -   what a competent speaker knows when he/she knows the term
        
## Simple causal theory
-   x represents y if and only if x is a reliable indicator of y in ideal conditions
	-   in ideal conditions → solves the disjunction problem
	-   ideal conditions → representation carries out its natural function (e.g. a heart pumps blood)
		-   teleosemantics → Teleosemantic theories provide an account of the content of mental states in terms of the proper functions of either mental states themselves or the mechanisms that produce them.
-   reliable indicators cannot misrepresent
	-   if there's no fire, then this smoke doesn't mean fire
	-   reliable means never prone to error, so can't misrepresent something
	-   example: amplitude is a reliable indicator of volume
-   disjunction problem
	-   you can have reliable causal connections between objects even when those objects are not what is being represented
	-   e.g. you can have a casual connection between yourself and a 'sheep'
-   pig example
	-   i see a pig X and represent to myself a pig Y
		-   look at a pig and believe that a pig is there
		-   X is a reliable indicator of Y
		-   but X doesn't _represent_ Y
	-   if pig X is actually a guy in a pig costume
		-   pig X is not actually Y in ideal conditions (not teologically equivalent to a real pig)
		-   which explains why X doesn't represent Y

## How do mental states cause and explain behaviour?
-   their intentional properties supervene on neurophysiological properties
-   supervenience → when A supervenes on B, there can be no difference in A without a difference in B
	-   vending machine example
	-   A is monetary value
	-   B is physical coin
	-   weak supervenience → someone is keeping it going by manipulating it. If they stop, the supervenience is no longer there
	-   strong supervenience → direct linear relation (e.g. speed of molecules of gas and temperature, they are directly correlated), based off of the rules of the universe
-   in dretske
	-   relies on the weak supervenience the government supports (i.e. that coins in a certain shape have monetary value)
-   ideal conditions → representation carries out its natural function
-   mind is to intentional actions what money is to the behaviour of a vending machine
    -   coins are deposited in the vending machine → beliefs, desires, and intentions, are in, or get produced in, us
    -   right coins deposited in the machine cause it to dispense a can of coke → the right mental entities occurring in us cause us to perform various actions
    -   what makes money money is not intrinsic (not shape, size, or density), but rather extrinsic or relational in nature (coins possess monetary value) → what makes a belief a belief is not its intrinsic neurobiological character, but rather extrinsic facts about it (has certain meaning or content, intentional properties)
        -   intrinsic → physical features
        -   extrinsic → added value through supervenience (something that if an alien came, they wouldn't be able to figure out just from looking at it)
-   is it the intrinsic or extrinsic properties of the coins that make the vending machine dispense a can of coke?
    
-   kim's solution
    
    -   explain the vending machine via the weak supervenience of value of money and the physical properties of the money
        -   vending machine relies on the physical properties of the money as a proxy for the actual value of money
    -   mental states cause and explain behaviour, because their intentional properties supervene on neurophysiological properties
    -   works best for mental states that strongly supervene on their physical properties like pain, itches, etc.
-   dretske's solution
    -   vending machines were designed to take money
    -   supervenience of monetary value onto the physical coin combined with the design explain why coins are deposited, a coke comes out
    -   explain why the coke comes out, depends on the physical properties of the coins (intrinsic properties)
    -   in humans
        -   replace vending machine design with evolution and learning (nature)
        -   the frog jumps when it detects a looming shadow but why?
            -   evolved → leap when shadows loom otherwise it dies (intrinsic)
            -   experience → learned to escape (extrinsic)
        -   what comes in through our perception (e.g. thoughts) cause our behaviour
            -   e.g. go to fridge because you thought there was a beer in the fridge
-   causal relevance → what explains/causes its behaviour?
    
    -   case of the coke machine, we put money in and get Coke out
-   how do we explain this?
    
    -   dretske → teleosemantics
        -   coke machines are designed by coke machine designers to specifically serve the purpose of dispensing coke
        -   teleological things relate to the function that things serve rather than the cause of why things happen
