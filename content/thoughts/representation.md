## Symbolic Representation
-   Dretske just kinda doesn't agree w/ the pioneer 10 space probe plate lmao
    -   symbols will not mean anything to any alien life
    -   we find it easy to understand because we have the context and we live on this planet
-   what sort of things can be representations
    -   words/pictures/numbers/diagrams
    -   state of mind, can represent almost anything at all
-   what sort of things can be objects of representations
    -   almost anything (physical objects, sentences, numbers, moods, feelings, emotions, non-existent things)
    -   pictures represent by resemblance → derivative [intentionality](thoughts/intentionality.md)
        -   ‘resemblance theory of pictorial representation’, or the 'resemblance theory'
-   X represents Y → suggests that representation is a relation between two things
-   is there a basic type of representation underlying everything else?
    -   Crane says mental representations are the most basic level
    -   pictures dont work
        -   represent by resemblance
        -   When we try to represent the difference between … and …, if … then …, and either … or … in pictures, we draw a complete blank. There just seems no way of doing it.
    -   words don't work either
        -   represent by convention (see [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md))
        -   same words in same context mean the same thing to different people
    -   all other kinds of representation all depend on mental representations in order to work
        -   many things that we take for granted cannot be represented in terms of pictures → e.g. relations between ideas like "if it doesn't rain this afternoon, we will go for a walk"
- Mental representations are either naturalistic or conceptual
	-   naturalistic → matter of correlation, "these spots mean measles", spots are a reliable indicator of measles
		-   teach us about the term, they appeal to natural laws and science
	-   conceptual → "this read light means stop", matter of convention, connection is arbitrary
		-   what a competent speaker knows when he/she knows the term
