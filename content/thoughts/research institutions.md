## Verses as a Research Institution
- what makes verses special to me is it funds work that wouldn't have been funded otherwise
	- this means work that *doesn't have clear go-to-market value*
		- e.g. writing essays
	- enabling people to do greenfield work they otherwise wouldn't have the confidence to go do
- research as a form of shared fiction + skyhooks
- question should be: does this fit into a larger arc of verses work
- verses larger arc of work should be a concrete yes to "does this help to realize the vision for a flourishing and interdependent cyberspace?"
	- artifacts as tools and infra: concrete reifications of abstract concepts into usable tools for communities/people
	- artifacts as statements/philosophy: building shared language and context to enable conversations (prefigurative politics!!)
	- artifacts as play or art: because all of this should be fun
- encouraging incubation for early stage work
	- vote on overtime work
	- inner circle of 10
	- verses outer cirlce
	- stronger distinction of verses in-group
		- who is "in" verses
		- propose tightening of verses core into its own server
		- current server is larger verses community server
