For representational democracy to work, we need to trust people to make informed decisions at the polls, so that we can hold politicians accountable to the real interests of their constituents

## Salience principles for democracy
By Susanna Siegel

> “Salience principle of importance”: idea that the press should make clearly available info that the public needs to know for democracy to work

- For the majority, they focus mainly on their own interests, interactions, and social pressures that leave politics and state institutions in the background. By default, political consciousness stays in the background of consciousness (Lippmann revers to these people as 'deaf spectators')
- Politics can become salient through elections, contact with the government (e.g. jury duty, drivers license, or a 'brush' with the law)
	- John Rawls: "In a well-governed state only a small fraction of persons may devote much of their time to politics"
- Lipmann: we need to bridge by means of mass communication. Journalists then, are the [epistemic](thoughts/epistemology.md) bridges between government and the public
- Newsworthiness: whatever is actually important for the public to know about
	- In a different context, can refer to whether it will attract attention if reported in a news outlet
- To make something salient is to put it forward as both demanding attention and deserving it. In can be distinct from actual uptake (as the receiving end can experience it as demanding of attention but not classify it as deserving it)
- Accountability/watchdog journalism: reporting on the working of government or political campaigns
	- Product in the leaders a fear of public embarrassment or public discrediting, public controversy, or fear of losing an election
- Problem of democratic [attention](thoughts/attention%20economy.md)
	- The library is full of good books, and the sad fact is that none of us will ever read them all. 
	- Arises from a combination of three points
		1. Professional journalism is governed by an importance principle of salience
		2. If journalism fulfilled the importance principle, some roles would depend on readers taking in information made salient by journalism
		3. For much important information, many readers have no interest in it, feel no prior motivation to learn it, and face substantial obstacles to paying attention to information even when it is widely available, and even when it would yield knowledge that would be useful to have
	- **The problematic upshot is that democracy imposes an attentional demand that can't easily be met**
	- Representative democracy relies on a population with stable, well-formed opinions about public policy who are disposed to select representatives ready to respect their preferences
	- Important news is often not sensational
		- Social media platforms on the other hand highlight content that captures user attention (maximizes occurrent engagement). Markers of virality are not co-extensive with information that is important for the public to know about
		- Framing, style, presentation matters a lot
- Public-as-protagonist principle
	- "recommends framing and selecting information to invite readers to view themselves and one another as potential political participants"
	- Stories should make explicit when it can the ways in which the reading public has a state in how the story unfolds and how the reader can affect its outcome
		- Not every reader will be a potential protagonist in every story. However, every regular reader is likely to encounter a story in which they feel addressed as a potential protagonist eventually
	- Underlying belief that there are many publics
