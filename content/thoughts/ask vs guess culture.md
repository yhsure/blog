*phrasing from Jasmine*

## Guess Culture
- High social cost in asking for things
	- Often *guess* at the reaction of the other in order to mitigate potential social cost (e.g. will not ask for things if it could be seen as out of place)
- Tend to ask for things less with the assumption that the other will most likely accept

## Ask Culture
- Low social cost in asking for things
- Will just ask and expect to be rejected more often, generally more forward
