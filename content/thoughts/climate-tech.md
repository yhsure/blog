"Today, carbon removal solutions face a chicken-and-egg problem. As early technologies, they’re more expensive, so don’t attract a critical mass of customers. But without wider adoption, they can’t scale production to [become cheaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects). Early purchasers can help new carbon removal technologies get down the cost curve and up the volume curve. Experience with manufacturing learning and experience curves has shown repeatedly that deployment and scale beget improvement, a [phenomenon](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052669) seen across DNA sequencing, hard drive capacity, and solar panels."
