Not just about investing in carbon removal or carbon offsets 
also about investing in the [infrastructure](/thoughts/infrastructure) to make it possible

[The Land Ethic](https://www.cooperative-individualism.org/leopold-aldo_land-ethic-1949.pdf) simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land. It changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the landcommunity to plain member and citizen of it.

## Investment Facts!

* Compared to just a year before, there were **~50% more climate deals** in Q2’21 vs Q2’20
* In the first half of 2021, climate tech startups raised **~$16b across ~250 venture deals**
* Mobility sector deals are the largest on average (~50% of total H1 2021 funding) whereas Food & Water and Mobility attract the greatest diversity across investment firms (>50% of investors are active in these sectors)

## Carbon Credits
[Source](https://features.propublica.org/brazil-carbon-offsets/inconvenient-truth-carbon-credits-dont-work-deforestation-redd-acre-cambodia)

Can we create 'credits' that companies can buy to offset their emissions by 'proving' that a forest is sequestering a certain amount of carbon?

Yet, in most of these cases, these carbon offsets don't actually work. They either
1. don't offset the amount they were supposed to do
2. bought gains that were quickly offset
3. amount of carbon couldn't be measured accurately

Ultimately leading polluters to get off scott free while the planet still suffers. Is this still ok thought? As long as some trees are saved and foreign aid is going toward protecting forests

Carbon offsets are just "charismatic carbon" -- they offer a feel-good story of environmental and social good without doing much

Originally was a compromise between European, American, and developing nations
1. European leaders wanted to create policies to encourage industry to polute less
2. Americans wanted flexibility
3. Devloping nations (e.g. Brazil) wanted money to deal with climate change

On paper, this seemed perfect: if it cost too much to reduce emissions in one area, you could 'buy' the equivalent offset. This in theory could incentivize orgs to try and develop more green tech (e.g. solar plant in favour of a coal plant) in anticipation of carbon credit sales

In practice doesn't work super well
1. Clean Development Mechanism: 85% of offsets had a 'low likelihood' of creating real impacts
2. Join Implementation: 75%

Leakage: protecting one patch of land could lead to deforestation somewhere else as loggers work to try and meet quotas

Preserving land and trees is hard in any developing country is hard: the poverty and lack of infrastructure "drives people to violate whatever protections are in place to plant crops or mine for gold or just have enough lumber to build their homes"

> When a tree is destroyed, all the carbon accumulated over its lifetime is released back into the atmosphere.

But there's not a lot of incentive for local residents
- Rubber sells for about 2 reais/kg (roughly enough for a cup of coffee) whereas a single cow is ~800 reais ($200)
- Sustainable logging didn't pay enough
- Government subsidies don't consider enough things
	- Digging fish ponds but they don't produce enough
	- Rubber-tapping tries but can't afford fertilizer for the poor Amazon soil

> “Cattle is a secure market. You can get a good income selling a calf, an ox,” Silva said.

> “Who is willing to rubber tap nowadays?” Brito said. “Nobody, practically nobody. We want an easier way to live.”

Gerrymandering but for trees? A lot of the offset calculations are based off of regional averages for carbon, projects can then take advantage of 'unusually high' concentration areas with certain types of trees to game the system and gain more credits than they should have.

This could actually benefit indigenous tribes because of their more conservative approach to logging -- in fact, offsets can enable tribes to reduce logging. However, "some tribal members are [deeply uncomfortable](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-carbon-trading-became-a-way-of-life-for-californias-yurok-tribe) with the idea of selling offsets to companies like this even if they are legitimate, fearing they’re effectively profiting from pollution."

## Company Initiatives
### Stripe

tldr; we need to develop new carbon removal tech, the ones we have right now are [unlikely to scale to well enough](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabf9f) to tackle the problem as it stands right now

"Today, carbon removal solutions face a chicken-and-egg problem. As early technologies, they’re more expensive, so don’t attract a critical mass of customers. But without wider adoption, they can’t scale production to [become cheaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects)."

"Early purchasers can help new carbon removal technologies get down the cost curve and up the volume curve. Experience with manufacturing learning and experience curves has shown repeatedly that deployment and scale beget improvement, a [phenomenon](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052669) seen across DNA sequencing, hard drive capacity, and solar panels."

### Shopify

General ethos: we don't know what works so let's invest in a little bit of everything

> There’s no easy fix for climate change, and no solution that will singlehandedly solve the problem. We have to try every possible nature-based and engineered option.

Mix of solutions that make a difference now (evergreen tech: 24%) but also emerging tech with big impact down the line (frontier portfolio: 76%) [Rationale](https://cdn.shopify.com/static/sustainability/How-to-Kick-Start-the-Carbon-Removal-Market_Shopifys-Playbook.pdf)

Frontier
1. Direct Air Capture -> directly pulling carbon out of the air and storying it permanently
2. Product -> storing carbon into usable products (e.g. concrete)
3. Ocean -> large bodies of water as carbon sinks while also reducing ocean acidification
4. Biomass -> sequester carbon in organic material, using organic material for energy
5. Mineralization -> turning carbon into a mineral to store

Evergreen (creating a buffer against climate change until we figure out how to unscrew ourselves)
1. Forest -> planting, restoring, and protecting forests
2. Soil -> farming techniques that improve soil health and carbon storage
3. Renewable Energy -> investing in fossil fuel alternatives
4. Transportation -> reducing emissions from transportation
