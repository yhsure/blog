## Arcosanti
A provocative concept of a compact city designed not around roads and cars but around people. 

Designed and established by Paolo Soleri, around same time as the [[thoughts/From Counterculture to Cyberculture|counter-cultural movements of "back to the land"]]

Arcology: the mixture of architecture and local ecologies

Dispersal is antagonistic to life. Density is the only [[thoughts/morphology|morphology]] that can give us a lively existence.

Wanted it to be a caravansary, a traditional inn with central courtyard for travelers in the desert regions of Asian or North Africa that often served as a stopover for ideas.

## Notes from *A people-centric smart city for racial justice*
-   cities are the backbone and hope of social change
-   either great benefit but also digital cages of surveillance and control
-   what is the role of cities in the post-pandemic phase?   
    -   laboratories for democratic and sustainable innovations
    -   smart, equitable, democratic cities
-   tech has market AND social power 
    -   9T market cap, more than the entirety of european stock market
- IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
    -   smart for whom?
    -   cities for whom?
-   types of cities
    -   big tech first → e.g. toronto (sidewalk labs)
    -   turn data into common good and infrastructure
    -   SHOULD be people first → make digital transformation work for all
        -   reduce inequalities
        -   affordable housing
        -   health care
        -   sustainable mobility
        -   ecological transition
        -   green public psaces
        -   reduce carbon emissions
    -   THEN see how we can apply tech
    -   **avoid techno-solutionism** -> [maintenance of existing systems](thoughts/creation%20vs%20maintenance.md)
-   involves citizen decision making
    -   [Making and Maintenance of OSS](thoughts/Making%20and%20Maintenance%20of%20OSS.md) tech + tech that preserves privacy
-   zero carbon cities of the future (energy transition)
    -   electrify our mobility, shift to renewables
    -   creating green spaces
    -   super blocks → make larger blocks, reclaim some roads for public use
-   agile digital transformation
    -   ethical digital standards for cities
    -   open source, open standards, [interoperability](thoughts/interoperability.md)
    -   _reproducibility_
    -   public money ↔ public code
    -   data is the raw material of the digital economy
        -   ML will increase ROI by anywhere from 10 to 30 percent
    -   data extractivism
        -   [surveillance capitalism](thoughts/Data%20Capitalism.md) → you are not the customer or even the product, you are the raw material
        -   black box society → strong need for public engagement
            -   what are the social, ethical, racial & geopolitical implications of automated decision systems ([software is political](thoughts/software%20and%20politics.md))
            -   latent costs of externalities related to manipulating data
        -   new deal on data → data as digital public goods
            -   data sovereignty, data portability, data trusts (data commons)
            -   privacy + security by design
            -   data infrastructure at city-scale
            -   open standards, open APIs
            -   access to historical, anonymized, and aggregated data which minimized privacy risks
            -   assess automated decision systems and ensure accountability (make algorithms public)
-   questions
    -   how do you have mass citizen participation if there's mass inequalities in the city?
        -   how do you include the traditionally excluded?
        -   participitary populations → ohh this would only be digitally native citizens
            -   actually not necessarily true, lots of more senior citizens and more impoverished people
            -   not a 'facebook democracy' → click here to sign a petition to solve a problem
            -   hybrid process, physical participation, digital part just enhances participation
        -   people of marginalized communities trust the government less (theyve failed them in the past)
            -   make public institutions more transparent and accountable too, not just a citizen problem
