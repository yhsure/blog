One of the things that keeps face-to-face friendships strong is the [nature of shared experience](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2001-00651-001): you laugh together; you dance together; you gape at the hot-dog eaters on Coney Island together.

It is really tempting to cover for mistakes by pretending they never happened.
“In Supreme Court opinions, every word matters … When they’re changing the wording of opinions, they’re basically rewriting the law.”

“It’s _gone_ gone. A piece of paper can burn and you can still kind of get something from it. With a hard drive or a URL, when it’s gone, there is just zero recourse.”

"Ephemerality is built into the very architecture of the web, which was intended to be a messaging system, not a library."

*Too* ephemeral? Move towards real time content.

Modern content is sometimes actually assembled on the fly through the likes of Ruby, Django, Next.js, etc. Not actual 'flat'/self-enclosed pages
