Uses 'stake' tokens to earn the right to become a validator of the blockchain. Users are chosen to become validators pseudo-randomly depending on various factors like size of stake, age of stake, etc. Validators check for validity of transactions, signing the block, and adding to the chain. Reward for the validator is the transaction fees.

The stake is a financial motivator for users not to validate or create fraudulent transactions (i.e. if you care about the chain, you should hope that members of the chain are also honest, mutual [trust](thoughts/trust.md))

TLDR; a set of validators take turns proposing and voting on the next block, and the weight of each validatorâ€™s vote depends on the size of its deposit (i.e. stake)

One of the alternatives to [PoW](thoughts/proof%20of%20work.md)

> Security comes from putting up economic value-at-loss rather than straight up burning energy

## Disadvantages
- Greater chance of [51% attacks](thoughts/fault%20tolerance.md)
	- Though this is questionable, 51% means you need to control 51% of the staked ETH which would probably cause ETH's value to drop significantly. There's very little incentive to destroy the value of a currency you have a majority stake in.
- Incentive to hoard tokens and not use them
