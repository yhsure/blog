How complex behaviour can arise out of seemingly simple rules? Is there anything special that causes emergent behaviour?
* Ant simulations
* Mold simulations
* [Community](/thoughts/communities) dynamics

Interesting to think about in context of single agents in multi-agent systems. How does [consciousness](thoughts/consciousness.md) arise? Is it just because of the rules itself (a reductionist approach) or is there something larger at play?

Even in systems of [representation](/thoughts/representation)
