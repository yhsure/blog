Evaporative Cooling is the slow decay of a community into mediocrity as its most 'high energy' or high value individuals exit.

It is a way to think about communities in terms of the average quality of its members.

When the most high value members realize there isn't much left for them to gain, they leave (Groucho Marx rule: you stop attending any event which would have you as participant).

This drop the average quality of the community down and the next level notices and then also finds it underwhelming. This continues until you get to a point where the people in the community are so unaware they no longer notice/care.

"If anyone can join your community, then the people most likely to join are those who are below the average quality of your community because they have the most to gain."

## Social Gating
Mechanisms which allow participants to self-select out of the group (vs traditional direct exclusion). 

e.g.
- nicheness/technicality (high prerequisite knowledge)
- social stigma
- high cost (time and money)
- difficult entry (hazing)
