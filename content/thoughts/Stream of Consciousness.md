Quotes from *The Principles of Psychology* by William James

> “Consciousness, then, does not appear to itself chopped up in bits. Such words as ‘chain’ or ‘train’ do not describe it fitly as it presents itself in the first instance. It is nothing jointed; it flows. A ‘river’ or a ‘stream’ are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. In talking of it hereafter, let us call it the stream of thought, of consciousness, or of subjective life.” – William James, Principles of Psychology

- Gaps and changes in quality that we do notice don't undermine the feeling that our consciousness is continuous (we bridge the gap between pre-gap consciousness easily)
- Gaps and changes in quality that we don't notice aren't felt as interruptions because we're not aware of them
- The stream of consciousness is really both a stream of perception and a stream of thought and attention shifts dynamically back and forth between them

> "When we take a general view of the wonderful stream of our consciousness, what strikes us first is the different [pace](thoughts/pace%20layers.md) of its parts. Like a bird's life, it seems to be an alternation of flights and perchings... Let us call the resting places the 'substantive parts' and the places of flight the 'transitive parts' of the stream of thought"

## Types of thought
- Spontaneous thought
	- Weak automatic and deliberate constraints
	- $\textrm{DN}_\textrm{MTL}$ (default network medial temporal lobe) exerts relatively strong diversifying influence on the stream of thought
- Rumination and obsessive thought (internally oriented thought)
	- Strong automatic constraints from $\textrm{DN}_\textrm{CORE}$
- Goal-directed thought
	- Strong deliberate constraints from the frontoparietal control network ($\textrm{FPCN}$)

### Spontaneous thought
- Unplanned, much like mind-wandering
- Contrast is between planned/deliberate thought versus unplanned or spontaneous thought

Guided Thought
- Counterfactual Aspect
	- One could alter their behaviour to bring things back on course
- Normative Aspect
	- Implies the monitoring and correcting of behaviour in relation to some norms
- Both goal-directed thinking and rumination fall under this category

## Abhidharma Buddhist Philosophy
- Abhidharmikas agree that the mental stream is always changing
- Appears to flow continuously only to the untrained observer. Deeper examination indicates that the stream of consciousness is made up of very short-lived and discrete moments of awareness
- Consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises
	- Just as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns -- when fire depends on logs, it is reckoned as a log fire
	- When consciousness arises dependent on eye and the forms it perceives, it is reckoned as eye consciousness (related: [epistemic instruments](thoughts/epistemology.md))
- **Mind** is a term for a collection of impersonal mental factors in constant flux
- **Person** is a term for a collection of impersonal psychophysical factors in constant flux

|External Bases|Internal Bases|Consciousness|
|---|---|---|
|Visual Forms|Eye|Eye-consciousness|
|Sounds|Ear|Ear-consciousness|
|Smells|Nose|Nose-consciousness|
|Tastes|Tongue|Tongue-consciousness|
|Mental phenomena|Mind|Mind-consciousness|

- In this philosophy, the mind is a series of mind moments, each with a consciousness and a collection of mental factors (*dharmas*)
- Breakdown of a mind-moment, there are various factors. Some occur in each moment of the mental stream, others are variable and come and go according to certain conditions.
	1. Contact/Sense Impression
		1. Something has an impact on the senses (e.g. light striking the eye)
		2. Initial impact
	2. Feeling/Sensation/Experience
		1. How does it feel? Pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral?
		2. Experiencing the object
	3. Perception/Recognition
		1. With that contact and sensation, what is it? What 'marks' this as distinct?
		2. Recognizing what distinguishes the object
	4. Volition/Intention/Will
		1. There is a direction in the mindstream either towards or away from something
		2. Gathering of other factors (Contact, Feeling, Perception, One-pointedness, Attention)
		3. Accumulating kamma
	5. One-pointedness/Concentration
		1. Way in which the awareness is centered around mental content or object
		2. Uniting mental factors
	6. Attention/Reflection
		1. Orienting towards something
		2. Joining mental factors to object
	7. Life Faculty/Vitality
		1. Basic aliveness, vitality of being
		2. Supports Volition

## Waves of Consciousness
*Waves of consciousness: ongoing cortical patterns during binocular rivalry*

An example of an [NCC](thoughts/Neural%20Correlates%20of%20Consciousness%20(NCC).md)

They measure brain activity using EEGs and they are seeing the expanding/contracting checkerboard ring
- Build-up in phase-synchronicity when the brain reports seeing the checkerboard ring (uninhibited)
- Motion can be perceived as either simultaneous or sequential depending *not on the delay between flashes or the stimulus* but at when you present the flash in relationship to the phase of the alpha rhythm
- There is very strong evidence for the content of perception being influenced by endogenous (intrinsic) neural rhythms at various spatiotemporal scales
	- What you perceive is a function of how your brain rhythmically parses the ongoing stream of sensory stimulation

![Model for perceptual cycles](thoughts/images/Pasted%20image%2020220304112345.png)*Red and blue lines illustrate two different perceptual cycles. If a stimuli occurs in two cycles, it is perceived as two separate stimuli whereas if it is in one cycle, it is perceived a single continuous stimuli*
