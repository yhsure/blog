## Basis
Cryptocurrencies use a distributed ledger (blockchain) to track all transactions in a publicly agreed upon manner.

All transactions are hashed. Hashing in general is a trivial function. To make it 'work', the network sets a difficulty for how much work can be expected to "mine" a new block. Mining is essentially just working to find a valid hash for a batch of transactions. A 'block' is a set of transactions.

Because the 'winner' is randomly-chosen proportional to the work done, it incentivizes everybody on the network to act honestly and record only true transactions.
 
> Proof of work makes it extremely difficult to alter any aspect of the blockchain, since such an alteration would require re-mining all subsequent blocks.
