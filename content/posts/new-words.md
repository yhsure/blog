*This is an expansion of thoughts on [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) and why we need new words. The following is a dialogue on the original consensus problem: agreeing on what we mean.*

**Characters**
- **W:** a wordsmith, a poet, a pluralist 
- **P:** a pedantic

**P:** Why do we need all these words? Don't we have enough words to express all we want to express already? There are innumerable ways to combine the words we already do have.

**W:** Ah, a question much asked throughout much of history.

**P:** Well no one seems to have a good answer at least. Who is to say that the word 'apple' even refers to the fruit I just ate, or that 'metaverse' is even a real word?

**W:** Language is logically decentralized, is it not? There is no governing body that determines what a word means. The meaning of a word lies in its use[^1], and that is decided by those who speak the language.

**P:** That is not necessarily true though. The word of the law quite literally sets out centralized definitions for words so that definitions cannot be swayed or morphed to fit to needs of its wielders. Similarly, at the start of a mathematical proof, one should *always* define the axioms or givens to be agreed upon before attempting to use them in any capacity.

**W:** There seems to be a flaw in your argument. Yes, I agree that a consistent set of definitions is required for any sort of productive knowledge sharing. But you fail to account for **plurality**. What is one to do with multiple definitions for the same word? I suspect this is a large reason why we humans are so easily able to keep seemingly contradictory statements in our heads.

**P:** Plurality as in a multitude of definitions?

**W:** Precisely.

**P:** Well that is almost certainly problematic as well, is it not? Too many competing definitions cannot be a good thing. We have dictionaries for a reason. How would anyone new to learning English be able to grasp the nuances of all of the meaning and history behind each term? It would get overwhelming incredibly quickly.

**W:** I concede that you have a good point. However, we can take a leaf out of Karl Popper's [^3] book: the *lie-to-children*. We can create simple glossaries and terminological definitions as some abstraction for the larger, more nuanced concepts of the real world.

**P:** Wait... lying is categorically bad is it not?

**W:** Hold on and let me finish my thought. According to Pratchett[^2], "a lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation." I think what I'm trying to get at is this concept of [verisimilitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude): that there is no binary true or false, some propositions are more true than others, especially in context.

**P:** Okay, I accept that taking a toy-model approach to new terminology makes sense. But I still don't understand why we couldn't just have a single definition for each word in this model.

**W:** My concern here is that with a 'standard' library of definitions, interpretations of concepts are not allowed to adapt to usage over time. 

- i think my worry with a 'standard library' is that there is no one 'unified' interpretation of a single concept, how will it adapt to usage overtime? wouldnt this anchor thought patterns to a shared 'truth'?
- on second, thought this ignores a lot of history: "By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be." erasure through terminology change
- agree that yes definitions are important, but history and plurality are vs important

- hesitant to 'root' new terms, terminology evolves in a decentralized way, centralizing meaning often concretizes meaning (which is good in the case of dictionaries but i dont think web3 is at that stage yet)
	- naming as power, but naming also anchors meaning
	- old meanings may no longer make sense. new groups try to co-opt old terminology. we accrue a plurality of definitions

natural meaning 'drift' -> see [labels-and-quantization](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md)

- the right to be forgotten -> its ok for terminology to be forgotten, for it to slip through the hands of time like sand

- how do we map meaning between languages

hard for things ingrained within society
meaning is not dictated by some central organization
it needs to be collectively forgotten, and/or overwritten

either hard-fork it within a subcommunity -> reclaiming words
or create an entirely new word

what words new to start anew?

the multiverse or pluriverse
