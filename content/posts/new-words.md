title: "When We Need New Words"

*This is an expansion of thoughts on [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) and why we need new words. This is the story of how a society deals with the original consensus problem: agreeing on what we mean.*

---

"Why do we need all these words? Don't we have enough words to express all we want to express already? There are innumerable ways to combine the words we already do have."

"Ah, a question much asked throughout much of history."

"Well no one seems to have a good answer at least. Who is to say that the word 'apple' even refers to the fruit I just ate, or that 'metaverse' is even a real word?"

"Language is logically decentralized, is it not? There is no governing body that determines what a word means. The meaning of a word lies in its use[^1], and that is decided by those who speak the language."

"That is not necessarily true though. The word of the law quite literally sets out centralized definitions for words so that definitions cannot be swayed or morphed to fit to needs of its wielders. Similarly, at the start of a mathematical proof, one should *always* define the axioms or givens to be agreed upon before attempting to use them in any capacity."

"There seems to be a flaw in your argument. Yes, I agree that a consistent set of definitions is required for any sort of productive knowledge sharing. But you fail to account for **plurality**. What is one to do with multiple definitions for the same word? I suspect this is a large reason why we humans are so easily able to keep seemingly contradictory statements in our heads."

"Plurality as in a multitude of definitions?"

"Precisely. "

- too many competing definitions is bad. we have dictionaries for a reason. how do new people learn terminology? it would get overwhelming incredibly quickly

- lie-to-children (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children, Karl Popper's)

- hm term overloading may be a problem
	- i think my worry with a 'standard library' is that there is no one 'unified' interpretation of a single concept, how will it adapt to usage overtime? wouldnt this anchor thought patterns to a shared 'truth'?
	- on second, thought this ignores a lot of history: "By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be." erasure through terminology change
- agree that yes definitions are important, but history and plurality are vs important

- ok sg, but this doesnt address people first learning terminology

- hesitant to 'root' new terms, terminology evolves in a decentralized way, centralizing meaning often concretizes meaning (which is good in the case of dictionaries but i dont think web3 is at that stage yet)
	- naming as power, but naming also anchors meaning

- 
	- old meanings may no longer make sense. new groups try to co-opt old terminology. we accrue a plurality of definitions

natural meaning 'drift' -> see [labels-and-quantization](thoughts/labels-and-quantization.md)

- the right to be forgotten -> its ok for terminology to be forgotten, for it to slip through the hands of time like sand

- how do we map meaning between languages

hard for things ingrained within society
meaning is not dictated by some central organization
it needs to be collectively forgotten, and/or overwritten

either hard-fork it within a subcommunity -> reclaiming words
or create an entirely new word

what words new to start anew?

the multiverse or pluriverse
