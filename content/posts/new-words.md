*This is an expansion of thoughts on [terminology](thoughts/terminology.md) and why we need new words. The following is a dialogue on the original consensus problem: agreeing on what we mean.*

---

**Characters**
- **W:** a wordsmith, a poet, a pluralist 
- **P:** a pedantic

**P:** Why do we need all these words? 

**W:** Ah, a question much asked throughout much of history.

**P:** Well no one seems to have a good answer at least. Don't we have enough words to express all we want to express already? There are innumerable ways to combine the words we already do have.

**W:** The whole point of language to have shared mental models to enable us to communicate complex ideas more easily. There is a form of epistemic injustice known as hermeneutical injustice where one has no labels or common terminology to describe or explain experiences to others. Clearly, there are not enough words to express the human experience.

**P:** Okay, I admit that new words are useful. But who is to say what each word means? Who is to say that the word 'apple' even refers to the fruit I just ate, or that 'metaverse' is even a real word?

**W:** Language is logically decentralized, is it not? There is no governing body that determines what a word means. The meaning of a word lies in its use[^1], and that is decided by those who speak the language.

**P:** That is not necessarily true though. The language of the law sets out centralized definitions for words *so* that definitions cannot be swayed or morphed to fit to needs of its wielders. Similarly, at the start of a mathematical proof, one should *always* define the axioms or givens to be agreed upon before attempting to use them in any capacity.

**W:** There seems to be a flaw in your argument. Yes, I agree that a consistent set of definitions is required for any sort of productive knowledge sharing. But you fail to account for **plurality**. Context modifies meaning.

**P:** Plurality as in a multitude of definitions?

**W:** Precisely.

**P:** Well that is almost certainly problematic as well, is it not? Too many competing definitions cannot be a good thing. We have dictionaries for a reason. How would anyone new to learning English be able to grasp the nuances of all of the meaning and history behind each term? It would get overwhelming incredibly quickly.

**W:** I concede that you have a good point. However, we can take a leaf out of Karl Popper's [^3] book: the *lie-to-children*. We can create simple glossaries and terminological definitions as some abstraction for the larger, more nuanced concepts of the real world.

**P:** Wait... lying is categorically bad is it not?

**W:** Hold on and let me finish my thought. According to Pratchett[^2], "a lie-to-children is a statement that is false, but which nevertheless leads the child's mind towards a more accurate explanation." I think what I'm trying to get at is this concept of [verisimilitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisimilitude): that there is no binary true or false, [some propositions are more true](thoughts/truth.md) than others, especially in context.

**P:** Okay, I accept that taking a toy-model approach to new terminology makes sense. But I still don't understand why we couldn't just have a single definition for each word in this model.

**W:** My concern with a 'standard' library of definitions is that interpretations of concepts are not allowed to adapt to usage over time. How does a dictionary or thesaurus adapt to the historical meaning of racial slurs, for example? Those who hold the ability to rewrite the past are the ones with power. Again, this is why having centrally controlled language is a bad idea. This was quite clear in Orwell's work.

Of course, this is not to say that definitions are not important. In fact, quite the opposite. Definitions hold immense power in shaping how we talk and think about the world writ large. What I am saying is that language needs to ability to evolve on its own. Individuals and groups should have the agency to 'reclaim' harmful and outdated definitions.

**P:** Isn't this exactly *why* we need centralization? This is like Plato's Ship of State[^4]. Any large vessel by their very nature need to be steered firmly. Those aboard must yield to their captain's commands; no reasonable person believes that a ship can be run democratically.

**W:** Would sailors want to obey a captain who takes them somewhere they don't want to be? No. I imagine language like multiple small ships, each one with its own crew (crew of course, meaning an agreed meaning for a set of definitions). Let me reiterate without the ship metaphor: language requires **localized** [consensus](thoughts/consensus.md) for it to function.

**P:** Ah, now I see that you don't mean complete [decentralization](thoughts/decentralization.md), that makes a lot more sense. I can agree on this. I am, however, curious about how local agreement should propagate to become widely accepted. After all, almost all English speakers can agree and what an 'apple' refers to, yet nobody seems to have a good definition for relatively newer terminology like the 'metaverse'.

**W:** This is an interesting question to think about. Not only do we need to think about spatial locality, but also temporal locality as well. I'd like to think about this in terms of metallurgical annealing if you'd let me.

**P:** As in the process of heating metal to make it more malleable?

**W:** Yes, exactly! Let us imagine definitions of words as metals. After a metal is heated to a high temperature, it is workable. Similarly, when new terminology is coined, it has a period where it is malleable and adaptive. To combine this with the ship metaphor, this is when the ship still has a small crew and achieving local consensus is relatively easy.

Of course, over the course of the annealing process, meaning can drift. Centralizing then, is a form of metal hardening. It anchors meaning and prevents it from being easily modified.

Just as one should not have metals be load bearing until they've hardened, semantically fluid terms should not be epistemelogically load bearing.

P: This answers how 

W: These two metaphors have helped clarify my thinking. Let us say that 



- the right to be forgotten -> its ok for terminology to be forgotten, for it to slip through the hands of time like sand
- this ignores a lot of history: "By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be." erasure through terminology change

hard for things ingrained within society
meaning is not dictated by some central organization
it needs to be collectively forgotten, and/or overwritten

either hard-fork it within a subcommunity -> reclaiming words
or create an entirely new word

what words need to start anew?
