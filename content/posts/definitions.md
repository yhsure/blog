language as an abstraction for concepts

abstraction involves a 

abstractions require an agreed upon meaning

would suck to redefine a word every time you used it



## Emergence of language
language is the means through which we communicate the vast majority of our ideas

need to communicate and refer to objects that are not spatially/temporally local

it enables the bandwidth through which we can express ideas, thoughts, dreams, aspirations, and fears to others
it has intent and meaning

language itself is compositional

it is not the individuals words that are the atoms of language, but rather definitions. the terminology, the context. these form the alphabet for thought to happen.

"A theorem is only a fact in the context of the axioms on which it is based." A sentence is only a statement in the context of the definitions of the words from which it is constructed.

## Importance of definitions
definitions carry weight: the context in which words are use dictate their meaning

‘In most cases, the meaning of a word is its use’, Wittgenstein claimed, in perhaps the most famous passage in the Investigations. It ain’t what you say, it’s the way that you say it, and the context in which you say it. Words are how you use them.

words give non-physical concepts meaning

- why this is important moving into a more abstract and digital world
	- more history than ever
	- more virtual things than ever
	- more abstract concepts than ever



## Terminological anchoring

- hesitant to 'root' new terms, terminology evolves in a decentralized way, centralizing meaning often concretizes meaning (which is good in the case of dictionaries but i dont think web3 is at that stage yet)
- naming as power, but naming also anchors meaning

## Definition overloading
- term overloading
	- i think my worry with a 'standard library' is that there is no one 'unified' interpretation of a single concept, how will it adapt to usage overtime? wouldnt this anchor thought patterns to a shared 'truth'?
	- "By changing what we were, you change what we are and what we are going to be." erasure through terminology change -> essentially just cooptation?
	- "Thus potential sources of uncertainty and misunderstanding arise in the form of homonyms (i.e. words that are used to denote more than one concept) and synonyms (i.e. more than one word for the same concept)."

do we need new words?
e.g. hacker

at nwplus, we have a slide on all our promo materials that explains that hackers don't actually 'hack devices' at hackathons

it actually means
