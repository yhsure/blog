## On Website Redesigns

> There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle?

> Whatever it is, thereâ€™s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity." --[Laurel Schwulst](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)

About every half a year, I get an intense urge to redesign my website. Some years I overhaul everything, ripping out the content and gutting the divs and p tags. Other years, I make only minor changes, giving it a fresh coat of paint and changing out old typography for new ones.

I find it hard to place a finger on exactly why I feel this way. The colours, font spacing, and content -- they don't feel 'me'. How did something that used to feel so perfect and intimate feel so alien and off-kilter?

My theory is that our digital artifacts and spaces are reflections of our real selves. We feel like we outgrow digital spaces just as we change, learn, and grow in real life.

In part, this is why I think having your own little plot on the internet to change and modify at your own whim is worth protecting. This is our last little bit of land in an era where we leave our wizardly powers to build worlds of our choosing at the door of digital giants.
