## On Website Redesigns

> There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle?
> 
> Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity." --[Laurel Schwulst](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)

About every half a year, I get an intense urge to redesign my website. Some years I overhaul everything, ripping out the content and gutting the divs and p tags. Other years, I make only minor changes, giving it a fresh coat of paint and changing out old typography for new ones.

I find it hard to place a finger on exactly why I feel this way. The colours, font spacing, and content -- they don't feel 'me'. How did something that used to feel so perfect and intimate feel so alien and off-kilter?

My theory is that our digital artifacts and spaces are reflections of our real selves. We feel like we outgrow digital spaces just as we change, learn, and grow in real life.

In part, this is why I think having your own little plot on the internet to change and modify at your own whim is worth protecting. This is our last little bit of land in an era where we leave our wizardly powers to build worlds of our choosing at the door of digital giants.

## Digital Legibility

When I reflect on the lived experience of identity, what comes to mind is something complex, intersectional, context-dependent, and subjective.

[describe more about personal identity, what it feels like]
[how i joke with friends, the subtle ways i do x]
[contextual, depends on the relation between myself and the world]

[but this is not how identity works online]
[what is your digital representation?]
	[generally data points about what you browse, online habits]
	[what you've posted, bought online, etc.]
	[notice how its all quantified, identity as a thing to be 'managed' or 'sold' or 'searched' for]
["What’s measured gets managed. What’s legible gets controlled."]
[online identity as a means of legibility a process of simplifying, restructuring, and labeling to enable control at scale]

[legibility on its own is not a bad thing per se]
[accountability of public projects]
[enables people to find what they are looking for]

[but the danger of this simplification is that it elides context]
- counter examples of legibility
	- [[thoughts/Verifiable Credential|VCs]] dont capture the full context of a 'credential' or token
	- didnt graduate because lazy or because of trauma from the death of parents?

[big companies makes identities legible so that they may measure, manage, and control our attention to optimize their ad revenue and sell our data]

[a la James C Scott Seeing Like a State, "A desire to make legible is a desire to construct systems that look simple when gazing down from a god’s eye view, when “seeing like a state”."]

[from To Live In Their Utopia]
“Absurdity and tragedy tend to manifest when bureaucratic imaginations diverge from reality and when people can’t override the delusions baked into those imaginations” It’s dangerous when a single source dictates the truth.

But when the institution _does_ wield power and people can’t just leave anymore, these institutions can (and do) get more and more detached from the lives and needs of people. Those bureaucracies construct their own worlds where everything gets “rationalized” in simplified, reductive language.

Systemized classification and quantification of the world acts as an interpretive and transformational force. In other words, quantization changes the world.

That system imposes its model upon the world, judging and punishing people who don’t fit the model that the algorithm produced in the interest of some ostensibily objective goal that designers insist is better than decisions humans make in some or many ways.”

These systems become more actively dangerous when they go from “making sense of the world” to “making the world make sense”

### Hidden impacts of legibility
- The failure follows a [Procrustean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procrustes) pattern:
	1.  Make a map to accomplish systemic goal
	2.  Reality is too complex and refuses to fit into map
	3.  Remake reality in the image of map
	4.  *Systemic collapse*

[upcoming approaches with SSI also have things to be wary of]
they are both, at the end of the day, encoding what it means to be legible
what other notions of identity may be useful?

## Verb-based Identity
when i think about what identity ultimately is ended up used for, its to gesture actions and verbs

ecology: study of the relationships between living organisms, and in the widest sense entails the study of the interaction and survival of ideas and program's (Bateson 1979)

ecology-like study for identity that is based on action-spaces

- "Such conceptualizations consider identity to be dynamic, multiple, informational, temporary, contextual. Whereas the noun-like conceptualizations attach actions and interactions to actors, the verb-like recognise that identity is co-emergent with actions and interactions in contexts."
- Identity, in what you might call a natural sense, is reciprocally defining and co-constitutive with relationships and information exchange (Wheatley & Kellner-Rogers 1996, 1998). Identities are immanent in contextual relationships, and relationships are immanent in information exchange. A person is a person through other persons (Birhane 2017).
- In other words, the dots (the nodes, the people) don’t simply define the joins (the edges, the relationships) as Social Networking 101 might have it. We dot the joins in contextual information exchange just as much as we might be said to join the dots. The joins are the pathways for information exchange and transformation, for organising, and the expansion of organisational identity. Joins give the dots their meaning, their contextual relevance, their identity, just as dots give the information exchange direction and potency. 
- not who you are, but what you are authorized to do. So, Keys, not IDs.
