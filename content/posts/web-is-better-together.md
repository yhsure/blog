> They hint at possibilities for technologies that we could use in our everyday life, not to accomplish well-defined tasks, but to expand in undefined directions. Open-ended and personal, they encourage us to play – seriously – with experiences, ideas and other people

- feels like a shift in the zeitgeist -- people want the old internet back
- response
	- agree heavily on pluralistic internet -- there is no one right answer for what it looks like
	- increasingly think so: [[thoughts/the garden and the stream]]
	- i found your call for community infrastructure to be very provocative
	- a big part of why decentralization and peer-to-peer fails is because people are so used to companies fronting the costs that they are unwilling to do it themselves (main reason why things like the web monetization api have not taken off and i suspect why friction for web3 apps remains incredibly high)
- minecraft
- scratch
- early days of being together in digital space
- software feels uniquely special because you dont need to ask for permission to make things
- The software I enjoy most as a player and a designer are those that let me decide how to play
- part of why i enjoy digital gardening so much
	- "The point of a garden is that it's a personal playspace. You organise the garden around the ideas and mediums that match your way of thinking, rather than off someone else's standardised template." (https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
- folk programming, [[thoughts/cozy software]], home-cooked software
	- https://cristobal.space/writing/folk
	- [[thoughts/Tools for Conviviality]]
	- "Science can be used to simplify tools and to enable the layman to shape his immediate environment to his taste"
	- "Just as pens were taken out of the hands of the scribe during the Reformation of Europe, we must take the code out of the hands of software engineers"
	- as you said, "Everything becomes tinkerable, so that everything we see is imbued with the personality and identity of many. The world is freer, more textured, more expressive."
- agentic technology
	- we should give people the ability to own technology, to bring it into their own complex life stories
- programming portals
	- bridge the gap between end-users and programmers
	- composability of programming
		- unix philosophy
	- as easy to use as user interfaces
	- This kind of accessible end-user programming on the web feels like something we've been dancing around for a decade
- protocols vs platforms
	- platforms enable you to do existing things more efficiently
	- protocols enable you to do entirely new things
- i should be able to design and program agents that can walk around the canvas and interact with the things i make and different websites like its an ecosystem to physically explore. every piece of media is a different data type that can be fed into different programs and apps that all talk to each other
- triple stores as a universally composable data store
-   mixed used development for internet
    -   tokyo run shops out of your basement but internet
-   cursors as embodiment of attention

		- ways of relating across the web is a beautiful way to put it
		- "I want to insist on an amateur internet; a garage internet; a public library internet; a kitchen table internet. At last, in 2023, I want to tell the tech CEOs and venture capitalists: pipe down. Buzz off. Go fave each other’s tweets."
		- Publishing on the internet is a solved problem; finding each other on the internet, in a way that’s healthy and sustainable … that’s the piece that has never quite fallen into place.

		- nat bad
		- hated needing to port forward as a kid
		- no one builds at this level anymore because its too damn hard, so the kids resort to frontend
			- "So much of programming today is busywork, or playing defense against a raging internet"
		- miss LAN
			- https://tailscale.com/blog/remembering-the-lan/
			- The LAN was a magical place to learn about computers. Besides the physical aspect of assembling and disassembling machines, I could safely do things unthinkable on the modern internet: permission-less file sharing, experimental servers with no security, shared software where any one machine could easily bring down the network by typing in an innocuous command. Even when I did bring down the network the impact never left the building. I knew who I had to apologize to.
		- even DHTs are not ideal
			- to get access to the DHT in the first place, you need to connect to a bootstrapping server, such as router.bittorrent.com:6881 or router.utorrent.com:6881. These are very lightweight servers which simply introduce you to the DHT. They still depend on the existence of ISPs and the internet backbone
		- "I am starting to think 50% of the ease and power of centralization is just a stable, public IPv4 address."
		- "As home internet users, we can only speak and request, not listen and serve."
		- The rise of “overlay networks” is a natural response to the limitations and frustrations of the public IPv4 internet, and I think their acceleration in the last few years deserves more attention.
			- These are illusory networks established on top of the public internet
		- "What I’m really interested in — what I dream about — is the opportunity to play with new protocols without taking on, perforce, the burden of infrastructure."
