been a while since I wrote about [digital gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md)

by and large still write for myself
writing as [knowledge distillation](thoughts/articles/research-debt.md)

what is my knowledge flow?
1. intake (reading)
2. processing
3. output
4. feedback
also being careful of tight [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback-loops.md)

been enjoying putting my work in public (both writing and code)
invite people in, people give thoughts and feedback
crazy to see people actually read and interact with what i put out
