> "Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness ... The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity." -- [Bernstein](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html)

We live in an information age. The amount of data we produce far outweighs what we consume, so much so that its extended far beyond our ability to make meaningful use of it. Even our modern day [search](thoughts/search.md) systems seem to be [falling apart](thoughts/search-or-be-found.md) under the stress of todays overwhelming flow of data with the quality of our search engines degrading from all of the SEO hacks, paid advertiser content, and clickbait headlines.

Over the past year, I've slowly found processes that have worked well in creating a little currated corner of the internet, rich with wonderfully curious people exploring exciting ideas. You may have noticed I merged my blog and digital garden under my main site. A lot has changed since I last wrote about processes in my [Digital Gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md) post and some are no longer accurate. 

This is a v2.

## What is digital gardening?
A digital garden is not a file cabinet, nor is it fully an index. A digital garden, in fact, is less so a well-kempt plot for farming and more so a mess of entangled growth. It is a network of interconnected ideas and thoughts, clustered by how they are associated with each other.

This is not because I don't like order, but because I think **a dash of chaos and entropy is good for new ideas**. They help connect two separate ideas that you normally would not have associated with each other, and to imagine the 'what if' more frequently.

My goal with a digital garden is not purely as an [organizing system](thoughts/organizing-systems.md) and information store, thought it works nicely for that. I want my digital garden to be a playground for new ways ideas can connect together. As a result, existing formal organizing systems like Zettelkasten or the hierarchical folder structures of Notion don't work well for me. There is way too much upfront friction that by the time I think about how to organize my thought into categories, I've lost it.

This is the problem with the file cabinet: it focuses on efficiency of access and interopability rather than generativity and creativity. Thinking is not linear, nor is it [hierarchical](thoughts/articles/city-is-not-a-tree.md). In fact, not many things are linear or hierarchical at all. Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological or hierarchical order for my thought processes? The ideal tool for thought for me would embrace the messiness of my mind, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order.

## How I garden
> Digital gardens focus not on being a definite source of truth, but rather a source which is constantly evolving as your own knowledge grows and changes

My blog made me scared of posting. I was scared of putting things into the public because I was anxious about all the different ways people could perceive it, both in the present and in the future. What if I posted something that people thought was *stupid*? Or worse yet, somebody would see my current work in the future and look down on me for how naive my thinking was. I was scared of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital-permanence.md).

But honestly, the more I wrote and just put things out there, the less that line of thinking made sense. The internet is pretty [ephemereal already](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md). It's hard enough to *willingly* create something people will remember a week from now, let alone for all of eternity. While this is still a non-zero probability, the consistent outpour of support and interesting comments I *did* get from posting made me feel it was worth it.

I still by and large write for myself. Writing, for me, is a form of [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md). It helps to clarify my thinking and condense my knowledge so I can easily articulate it to others. If done well, I have a **shareable representation of my thoughts** that I can send out into the world and people can respond. Even for my most half-baked thoughts, this helps me create a feedback cycle to strengthen and fully flesh out that idea.

Digital gardening is not just passive knowledge collection. It's a form of expression and sharing.

Here are some learnings over the past year of digital gardening:
- Link by concept rather than by exact match. I will often explicitly have a `Related: (some concept)` link somewhere if I feel two subjects are closely associated. These have helped me find really cool connections on numerous occasions. 
- Name notes to be as simple as possible. Prefer using verbs or nouns to make it easier to link
- better distinguish between source and thoughts
	- source for attribution

I use search as an entry-point into a single node, the recall by associativity rather than by indexing. (e.g. I'd like to explore the ideas surrounding tools-for-thought)

When I search, I usually don't know the exact name of the thing I'm looking for, otherwise, why would I be searching for it in the first place?







Instead, the goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops.

linking new knowledge to existing knowledge makes it easy to remember

what is my knowledge flow?
1. intake
2. processing
3. output
4. feedback
also being careful of tight [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback-loops.md)

been enjoying putting my work in public (both writing and code)
invite people in, people give thoughts and feedback
crazy to see people actually read and interact with what i put out

## Inbox Method
Use Slite and Pocket to have an inbox of temporary thoughts
keeps my todos, unsorted thoughts, notes to read

even when reading books, I don't like to take complex notes right away will only keep bookmarks and come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts

this weeds out unnecessary noise and also is a chance for spaced repetition

### Seeds
low friction way to evaluate new ideas
new tab page

### Saplings
single nodes
do not silo notes into categories, prevents us from making surprising connections

### Branches
connect ideas where possible
thread thoughts whenever possible

### Fruits
creating 'newer' work from branches -> mostly longer form essays, projects, etc.
sharing the products of your labour with others

right now,  traditional 'tools for thought' are not great for this
