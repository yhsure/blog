been a while since I wrote about [digital gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md)

less so a well-kempt, more so a mess of entangled growth
its not because i dont like order
but because chaos and entropy is good for new ideas

thinking is not linear, nor is it [hierarchical](thoughts/articles/city-is-not-a-tree.md). in fact not many things are linear or hierarchical at all, let's not coerce things to be

balancing intake and output -> [2020](posts/2020.md)

the scientific method and progress are not linear -> karl popper on [truth](thoughts/truth.md)

not just passive knowledge collection -> it's not just knowledge collection
writing as distilled thought, condense your knowledge and create a feedback cycle (even if you're not super confident in it!)

scared of building in public because of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital-permanence.md) but honestly the internet is pretty [ephemereal-content](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md). its hard enough to create something people will remember a week from now, let along for all of eternity

Instead, the goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops.

[project-list](thoughts/project-list.md)

"I'd like my browser history to be like a bonsai tree Carefully growing, trimming, pruning, artfully shaping a beautiful tree of resources and ideas"

Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological order for my thought processes? The ideal tool for thought would embrace the messiness of our minds, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order.

linking new knowledge to existing knowledge makes it easy to remember

> Thinking is not only non-linear, it's messy. It involves a lot of back and forth, dead ends, branching, walking back, merging ideas, changing ideas, contradicting ideas. When I picture what my thoughts look like—the actual process of navigating different ideas in my head—I don't see a nice straight road with check points, I see a massive web of tangled threads.

by and large still write for myself
writing as [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md) and crystallized thought

writing things that I wish existed already

what is my knowledge flow?
1. intake (reading)
2. processing
3. output
4. feedback
also being careful of tight [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback-loops.md)

been enjoying putting my work in public (both writing and code)
invite people in, people give thoughts and feedback
crazy to see people actually read and interact with what i put out

## Inbox Method
Use Slite and Pocket to have an inbox of temporary thoughts
keeps my todos, unsorted thoughts, notes to read

even when reading books, I don't like to take complex notes right away will only keep bookmarks and come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts

this weeds out unnecessary noise and also is a chance for spaced repetition

### Seeds
low friction way to evaluate new ideas
new tab page

### Saplings
single nodes
do not silo notes into categories, prevents us from making surprising connections

### Branches
connect ideas where possible

thread thoughts whenever possible

### Fruits
creating 'newer' work from branches -> mostly longer form essays, projects, etc.

### Making time to tend to your garden
