> "Gardens … lie between farmland and wilderness ... The garden is farmland that delights the senses, designed for delight rather than commodity." -- [Bernstein](http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Gardens.html)

been a while since I wrote about [digital gardening](posts/digital-gardening.md)

things i've learned
- name things verbs or nouns to make it easier to link
- better distinguish between source and thoughts

less so a well-kempt, more so a mess of entangled growth
its not because i dont like order but because chaos and entropy is good for new ideas

thinking is not linear, nor is it [hierarchical](thoughts/articles/city-is-not-a-tree.md). in fact not many things are linear or hierarchical at all, let's not coerce things to be

As a slower, clunkier way to explore the internet, they revel in not being _the_ definitive source, just _a_ source, says Mike Caulfield, a digital literacy expert at Washington State University.

## The File Cabinet approach
Each time a change is made to any given file, it has to be tracked down and updated in every location in which it exists. This leads to redundancy, with a cluttering of near-identical ideas, and significant work any time a system-wide change is required. [From the Roam whitepaper](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/dZ72V0Ig6)

The network is dynamic, so updates and revisions are populated across the entire graph simultaneously.

## Digital Mind Mapping
[Source](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1979742.1979910)

creating an ontology -> a fundamental data object for organizing knowledge in a structured way
* vertices -> a set of concepts
* directed edges -> relationships connecting concepts

a digital garden in a sense is then deeply structured data that is composed into an ontology

"By providing a graphical overview of thought processes and connecting related concepts, mind maps can localize related concepts, reducing the cognitive load associated with retrieving and maintaining different knowledge elements"

## Automated Knowledge Discovery
the focus of modern information systems is moving from "data-processing" towards "concept-processing", meaning that the basic unit of processing is less and less an atomic piece of data and is becoming more a semantic concept which caries an interpretation and exists in a context with other concepts.

balancing intake and output -> [2020](posts/2020.md)

the scientific method and [scientific progress](thoughts/scientific-progress.md) are not linear -> karl popper on [truth](thoughts/truth.md)

not just passive knowledge collection -> it's not just knowledge collection
writing as distilled thought, condense your knowledge and create a feedback cycle (even if you're not super confident in it!)

scared of building in public because of [digital permanence](thoughts/digital-permanence.md) but honestly the internet is pretty [ephemereal already](thoughts/ephemereal-content.md). its hard enough to create something people will remember a week from now, let along for all of eternity

Instead, the goal should be to tap into your network's collective intelligence to create constructive feedback loops.

Then why is it that most tools and thinking strategies assume a nice chronological order for my thought processes? The ideal tool for thought would embrace the messiness of our minds, and organically help insights emerge from chaos instead of forcing an artificial order.

linking new knowledge to existing knowledge makes it easy to remember

by and large still write for myself
writing as [knowledge distillation](thoughts/knowledge-distillation.md) and crystallized thought

writing things that I wish existed already

what is my knowledge flow?
1. intake (reading)
2. processing
3. output
4. feedback
also being careful of tight [feedback loops](thoughts/feedback-loops.md)

been enjoying putting my work in public (both writing and code)
invite people in, people give thoughts and feedback
crazy to see people actually read and interact with what i put out

## Inbox Method
Use Slite and Pocket to have an inbox of temporary thoughts
keeps my todos, unsorted thoughts, notes to read

even when reading books, I don't like to take complex notes right away will only keep bookmarks and come back to the bookmarks a second time to generate insights and actual thoughts

this weeds out unnecessary noise and also is a chance for spaced repetition

### Seeds
low friction way to evaluate new ideas
new tab page

### Saplings
single nodes
do not silo notes into categories, prevents us from making surprising connections

### Branches
connect ideas where possible

thread thoughts whenever possible

### Fruits
creating 'newer' work from branches -> mostly longer form essays, projects, etc.

### Making time to tend to your garden
