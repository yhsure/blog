A year ago, I wrote myself a [[posts/2021|letter]]. In it, I told myself that if I ever found an idea I had high conviction in, I would drop everything to give it a fair shot. I hoped that I would be ambitious in my dreams and to embody a [quiet confidence](https://www.spencerchang.me/experiments/100posts/quiet-confidence/) in my own abilities and interests.

[[thoughts/Rhizome Proposal|Rhizome]] turned out to be project that would let me do all of that. I spent this past summer doing independent research focused on how we can enable [[posts/towards-data-neutrality|data neutrality]] on a web dominated by data moats. I had no academic research experience, barely knew anything about distributed systems, and didn't personally know anyone else doing independent research. At the time, I had no idea it was even *called* independent research.

I'm not sure what drew me in about it exactly. The project started out with a smattering of thoughts around peer-to-peer networking and what I found frustrating about it. And yet, the project took up latent headspace, simmering away quietly only to surface mid-scrub in the shower or on a walk to the bus stop. 

I knew that 'good' research practice usually involved writing a detailed research statement or proposal to present exactly what one would work one. I also knew that I had no clue how I would manifest the stirring pot of concepts into something legible. I spent the months leading up to summer bumping around in the  dark, trying to phrase and form what exactly about this interested me so much. In my head it felt clear, but everytime I tried to force those ideas through my fingers and onto the page they seemed to flit away and vanish, refusing to be expressing any precise form.

At the time, this felt like useless floundering. After all, what kind of researcher doesn't even know what they are researching?  But over time, it would turn out that this floundering was sense-making hard at work. Researching to figure out what you are researching... is still research. There is a certain amount of looking around and orienting yourself you need to do before you know what direction to head. I spent hours cautiously broaching the idea with friends over late night transit rides home. In most conversations, my friends nodded blankly, happy to see me obviously deeply invested into an idea but not really understanding what I was blabbing on about.

Like a mantra, I repeated to myself:

> Explaining things is hard. Making things legible is hard. Sensemaking is hard.

In these early days, I was often dejected. I felt incredibly foolish for pursuing something I had absolutely no reason to be so deeply invested in, and I felt foolish that I couldn't explain *why* it felt so compelling to me. I felt a deep need to *prove myself*. Maybe it was to prove to myself that I wasn't wasting the summer away or to others around me that I was doing something just as valid as their internships, startups, or academic research.

Over the span of a month period, I had 3 separate emotional breakdowns 
1. On May 11th: "I can't help but sometimes feel like I'm wasting my time -- there are so many smart people working on the same problem, what makes me feel like I can be the one to make a meaningful contribution to it?"
2. On May 16th: "I'm often spending 12+ hour days writing grants and I just feel so behind. And I don't get why!!!! I've been looking forward to this summer for so long."
3. On May 27th: "Once again had a breakdown :)) Constantly feel like I'm not doing enough and that time is slipping between my fingertips..."

In mid-conversation with someone who's opinion I cared deeply about, I realized that I strongly needed to figure out how to untie my self-worth from my project. I constantly felt like giving up because the project constantly made me question myself and my conviction.

I was in the middle of the midwit bellcurve. When I started with the project, I had a healthy dose of naivete, a belief that *anyone* could make a change and make their project work if they tried hard enough. But now, I started to believe that hard things are hard for a reason and that I should leave hard problems to people who are actually skilled and have spent decades of their lives working on these problems. Who was I to think that I, an undergrad student who had still yet to take a distributed system course, would be able to contribute anything meaningful?

Needless to say, I lost steam for a while.

Midsummer, I picked up Annie Dillard's *[[thoughts/The Writing Life|The Writing Life]]* on a whim from a local bookstore and read it cover to cover. In it, she mentions that the greatest teacher of writing is the blank page.

> Who will teach me to write? a reader wanted to know.
> 
> The page, the page, that eternal blankness, the blankness of eternity which you cover slowly, affirming time’s scrawl as a right and your daring as necessity; the page, which you cover woodenly, ruining it, but asserting your freedom and power to act, acknowledging that you ruin everything you touch but touching it nevertheless, because acting is better than being here in mere opacity; the page, which you cover slowly with the crabbed thread of your gut; the page in the purity of its possibilities; the page of your death, against which you pit such flawed excellences as you can muster with all your life’s strength: that page will teach you to write.

It was this lone paragraph that I think was the turning point where I started to believe that this applied to independent research too.

To do independent research is to learn how to confront the infinite possibility of a blank canvas. To not be intimidated by the possibility of making a fool of yourself, but to embrace the courage to even put brush to canvas, pen to paper. **To assert your freedom and power to act.**

The midwit would think it truly silly to try and change something as entrenched in our society as the very computing fabric we tap into everyday. But those who do not submit to this status quo recognize there is merit to trying regardless. As Octavia E. Butler gestures to this tension between optimism and pessimism, and the possibility of actually breaking through to something new:


> *There is nothing new*
> 
> *under the sun,*
> 
> *but there are new suns.*
> 
> -- Octavia E. Butler, *Trickster*

In early June, I had my first call with people who were equally excited about the idea as I was
- people who have been working long in the space seem excited about new and younger folks in the space

Later on, while reading weaving the web -> more reassurance that new things take a while
- tldr; it is reassuring to hear that it took almost 13 years to combine the Internet and [[thoughts/hypertext|hypertext]] together to conceptually create the Web. Even then, it took a lot of trying over many years to bring adoption for something that many didn't really see as potentially revolutionary

- when people ask about where I am working this summer, i often laugh and reply I'm 'funemployed'
- then I tell them that what I'm *really* doing is independent research and they ask "with who?"
- i laugh again and say that "that's the fun part about independent research, I get to do it on my own!"
- I think the whole career advice of go do internships at big companies and academic research as the two main options is incredibly flawed

on [Archipelagos]
- I still believe that the future lies not with the great powers, but with the little islands, lands, and cities.
- research doesnt need to be within these monolithic institutions

[new science]
Their plan is to not replace traditional academic institutions, but to develop alternative/complementary ones to provide 'competitive pressures' on existing ones. New Science is to research as Silicon Valley was to entrepreneurship.

"Instead, I believe that the most promising way to achieve large-scale improvement in the way basic scientific research is organized is to start small, help individual scientists, and to make [small steps towards a much better world](https://marginalrevolution.com/)."

and again, independent doesn't mean by yourself -- just not tied to existing institutions
i found it so invaluable to surround myself with people who were similarly intellectually curious about the world

Having dreams and working to make them reality is a privilege in this world, but I think it’s one of the greatest gifts of life. I feel so much energy working on things that give me purpose that it’s hard for me to imagine forcing myself to do things that I couldn’t care for, let alone outright disagree with.

if all i do this summer is to open this path as a possibility for more people to pursue this type of work, 

So that's my invitation to you. Come dream a little.
