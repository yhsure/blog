Clouds are fuzzy
whisps and tufts
where do they start and end?

the modern cloud
as infrastructure
also has a fuzzy definition

how do we define infrastructure? can internet infrastructure be neutral?

1. are definitions useful
2. language impacts thought (linguistic relativism)

thinking in abstractions
but things happen at the infrastructure layer

examples
1. cloudflare internet outtage
2. parler and aws
3. net neutrality
