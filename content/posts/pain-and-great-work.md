- whiplash asks the question “what is worthwhile”
	- pursuing what you are naturally good at vs forcing yourself to do something you think is good
		- probably tied to scientific freedom/taste argument
			- [[posts/aesthetics-and-taste|aesthetics-and-taste]]
	- "You're incredibly gifted, Sam. But it is worth noting that to be good at something is not quite the same as loving it."

			- Chuckie's confrontation with Will: "You're sitting on a winning lottery ticket and you're too chicken to cash it in"
				- Chuckie: Look, you got somethin' that none of us —
				- Will: Oh, come on! Why is it always this, I mean, "I fuckin' owe it to myself to do this or that?" What if I don't want to?
				- Chuckie: No. No, no, no. No, fuck you. You don't owe it to yourself. You owe it to me. 'Cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be 50. And I'll still be doing this shit. And that's all right, that's fine. I mean, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit. 'Cause I'd do anything to fuckin' have what you got. So would any of these fuckin' guys. It'd be an insult to us if you're still here in 20 years. Hanging around here is a fuckin' waste of your time.

			- Will's eventual choice to "go see about a girl" rather than take the prestigious NSA job
				- was this the right decision?

			- does shinji pilot the mech because he has to to get the love he wants or because he actually likes piloting it?
				- asuka apparently likes it?
			- when you are the only person who can do something, do you have a responsibility to do it?
			- Shinji must ultimately decide whether life's pain is worth experiencing for the possibility of connection and meaning.
				- The Human Instrumentality Project offers an escape from individual suffering by dissolving all boundaries between people - essentially eliminating the self and the pain that comes with it.

- how much great work has gone undeveloped because we didnt push someone hard enough?
	- fletcher in the movie implies that we lose a lot because of this
	- but what actually happens to neuman? he’ll likely fucking lose it in 30 years and turn into fletcher or kill himself like sean casey
		- will he be good at what he does? probably
		- will he be fulfilled? no
		- fletcher prays on neuman feeling inadequate, constantly moving the goal posts making it impossible for fletcher to be truly actually pleased
		- fletcher has no regard for the actual people hes bullying, just respect for the craft
			- is it wrong to idolize people like fletcher?
			- TK
	- can truly great work be done while fueled by desire to prove oneself?
		- yes but its not sustainable
		- 
		- TK
	- i’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of having a fletcher-like personality in my own life
		- how has this shaped me as a person?
		- 
- can obsession ever be healthy?
	- seasonality re: robin sloan

- being Serious (tm) is good actually
	- see Timothée Chalamet acceptance speech
	- its a commitment!! and admitting the possibility of failure!!
	- "When you meet someone with devotion and care for their craft, they have thinner barriers between their soul and the external world." (https://substack.com/home/post/p-157587475)

- in many cases, it is the doing of the work that matters
	- e.g. ai making ppl think less is bad actually

## simon sarris efforts and goals and joy
- I find it ideal to always have more ambitions, plans, and projects than one could possibly accomplish. Aspirations — even unlikely ones, maybe _especially_ unlikely ones — are an essential part of living well. When we are at our most ailing, we are reduced to thinking and talking only of our ailments. When we are at our most vigorous, our most alive, we think and talk of our goals and aspirations. Over long time frames, the pessimist becomes an unobservant man, and the optimist creates the world.
- Dreaming alone is seductive, even a little sweet, since it lacks the pain of trying.
- You should have ideals, but you cannot only love an idealized future, you must cultivate a love of effort, too. If you _really_ want something, then the soul must make demands of the body.
- What can I attempt that will be worthwhile, serious enough that it might end in failure?

## notes on work
- feels good when its on own volition
- 'dont want to do it because you told me to' effect

## what do i want to do with my life
- i like understanding the systems i like working with
- i like when i can translate things clearly from the abstract into concrete reality
	- understanding helps immensely with this
	- i like software i like pottery
- is it hard / painful?
	- yes and frustrating
	- but the process is fun

- how much company do i like?
	- actually most of my hobbies are pretty solitary and i like being locked in for a lot of them

- hypothetical super high paying job
	- design engineering lead (is this what i want?)

	- how does the comp materially change things?
- what could be better about my current role?
	- what more am i hoping to get out of my current role?
	- how am i looking to grow?
